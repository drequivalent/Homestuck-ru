<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: hi happy birthday rose!!! &lt;3</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hello, and thanks.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: did you get johns present yet?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I just opened it this very moment. What a stunning coincidence you would ask about it now. I am stunned.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah i know!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: what will you make with it?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And who said it was something from which something else could be made?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well john did tell me what it was duh.....</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I suppose I'll take a stab at learning the craft.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's the least I can do in response to the subtle dig concealed in his gesture.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: He often tells me I &quot;need a new hobby&quot; when I make perfectly reasonable analytical remarks.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh but rose i dont think he meant anything like that by it!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you see not everybody always means the opposite of what they say the way you and dave always do</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: His birthday is in a few months, isn't it?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yep!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i finally finished a present for him</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ive been working on it for years!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Years?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's so hard to tell when you're joking.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Or if you're even capable of it.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: heheheh.... :)</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i just mailed it too so it is sure to get there on time</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: mail takes a while to get anywhere from here!!!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'll probably craft something with strong sentimental value.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That should burn him.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i dont think you really mean that!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess not.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So, shall I expect a green package dropped to my house via airmail from whatever screwball cranny of the globe you're tucked into?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: err.......</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: no :(</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: sorry but you are sort of hard shop for &lt;_&lt;</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: besides i have something for you today that i think you will like better than some thing in a box!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it is a tip!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This is already intriguing enough to compensate for the grave scarcity of lavish gifts parachuting from the sky. Please go on.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: did you have a pet a long time ago that died?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ok well how did you feel about your cat, did you love him a lot?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: &quot;ok well&quot;, I didn't mention it was a cat, or that it was a male. Let's pretend I'm surprised and you're embarrassed and move on.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: To answer your question, I would describe my feelings toward the animal as lukewarm.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ummmmm ok....</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: thats fine!!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it doesnt really matter i think, just.....</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: what if someone told you you could play a game that would bring him back to life?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: If someone told me that, I would regard the remark with a great deal of skepticism.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: If that someone was you, on the other hand, then I would have to ask preemptively:</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is that someone you?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes that someone is me!!!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i just thought you might find it interesting</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So what is this game?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh i dont know</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: im just saying is all</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i think youll hear about it later and maybe you can talk to john and dave about it</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: they are way more into all that stuff than i am!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'll see what the word on the street is about it. In due time.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: For now I should probably order a copy of Knitting for Assholes. It would be a shame if I ran late with John's present.</span>
