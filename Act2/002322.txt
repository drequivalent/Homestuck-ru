<span style="color: #00d5f2">NANNASPRITE: Above <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Medium</span>, beyond <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Seven Gates</span>, residing at the core of <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Incipisphere</span> is a place known as <span style="text-decoration: underline">Skaia</span>.</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">NANNASPRITE: Legend holds that <span style="text-decoration: underline">Skaia</span> exists as a dormant crucible of unlimited creative potential. What does this mean, you ask? I'm afraid my lips are sealed about that, dear! Hoo hoo!</span>
