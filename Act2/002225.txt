You open the HEPHAESTUS web browser and direct it to your ironically maintained blog where you post monthly satirical reviews of GAMEBRO MAGAZINE. Your latest post is a review of the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scraps/gamebro_march.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">MARCH ISSUE</a>.

You've been meaning to write a review for the latest issue too, but you've been sort of dogging it. Something about the game they're reviewing just doesn't strike you as ripe for satirical purposes.
