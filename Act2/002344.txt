Dude, that bird is long gone. It probably won't last long in this heat anyway.

You don't even know what's up with this sick heat. The sun threatens to set but won't step off. It's staring you down, like the big red eye of a hot needle skipping on a groove its tracing 'round the earth.

When the pimp's in the crib ma
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot...&quot;

-English Romantic poet, John Keats
