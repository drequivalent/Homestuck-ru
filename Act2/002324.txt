<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ME??</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">NANNASPRITE: Yes, you, John!</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">NANNASPRITE: Before your mishap with my ashes, you may recall the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sprite</span>'s previous incarnation, which resulted from its <span style="text-decoration: underline">Kernel</span>'s &quot;hatching&quot;.</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">NANNASPRITE: You see, this hatching occurs automatically in response to your arrival! The result is a pair of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Kernels</span>, one dark, one light, each carrying the information they were prototyped with before the hatch!</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">NANNASPRITE: One goes down, to a kingdom entrenched in darkness. The other, up, to a kingdom basking in light! Each comes to rest in an <span style="text-decoration: underline">Orb</span> atop a <span style="text-decoration: underline">Spire</span>, of which there are three others in kind. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Four Spires</span> are situated above a throne, and these two thrones preside over the two respective <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sovereign Powers</span>!</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">NANNASPRITE: And once the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Kernels</span> are situated, that is when the game is afoot. The true war begins, light versus dark, good versus evil.</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">NANNASPRITE: This is a war that the forces of light are always destined to lose, without exception!</span>
