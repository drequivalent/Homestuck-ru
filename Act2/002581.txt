You empty the peculiar cabinet and take a quick inventory of your canned goods.

You have BEANS, MUSTARD, GRAVY, BREAD, SHRIMP, ASPARAGUS, CHEESE, RICE, CORN, PEAS, FLOUR, CHESTNUTS, MAYO, HAM, POTATOES, and SQUASH.

Such bountiful plenty. And yet the delights taunt you from within their small metal prisons.
