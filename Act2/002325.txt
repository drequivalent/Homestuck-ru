<span style="color: #00d5f2">NANNASPRITE: That remains for you to find out, dear! For you see, the journey you are about to take is <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Ultimate Riddle</span>!</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">NANNASPRITE: For now, your objective is to proceed towards <span style="text-decoration: underline">Skaia</span>, and pass through <span style="text-decoration: underline">The First Gate</span> situated directly above your house, not even terribly far! The Gates will become progressively more difficult to reach, so you had better be prepared to sharpen your adventuring skills!</span>
