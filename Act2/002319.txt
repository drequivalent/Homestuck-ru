<span style="color: #b536da">TT: No. For now I have retired to the safety of a smaller building which is much closer to the forest fire threatening my residence.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh well thats a relief</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: john told me to get the game to help get you out of there so im working on that now</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: dont tell john this but i think he might have been right about the puppets</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: theyre sort of starting to freak me out a little</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You're referring to your brother's collection?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i mean dont get me wrong i think its cool and all</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the semi-ironic puppet thing or whatever</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or semi-semi ironic</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: man i dont even know</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im just starting to think some of this shit is going a little far and its kind of fucked up</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've seen his websites.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I like them.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: haha yeah well YOU WOULD</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh man i wish lil cal wouldnt look at me like that</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: with those dead eyes jesus</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: sometimes i dream that hes real and hes talking to me and i wake up in a cold sweat and basically flip the fuck out</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Interesting...</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh god why did i just tell you my dream</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: youre going to have a field day with that</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I am currently scrawling notes furiously into one of the many psychoanalysis journals I maintain for you. Published papers forthcoming.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Because, you know, it's not like either of us have anything better to do at the moment than to evaluate each other's radically debilitating pathologies.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah im gonna get moving</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh have you heard from john</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: hes not answering me</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: He won't answer me either.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But I am watching him.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I suspect he is preoccupied with the fact that he just had a bucket of water dumped on his head by the ghost of his dead grandmother, who also happens to be dressed like a clown.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: hahahahaha</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: alright im out</span>
