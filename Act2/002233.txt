<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Either that, or flagrant homosexuality.</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Sometimes I wonder how you are ever allowed to pay for meals in restaurants.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It must be hard to keep a low profile when you're always overhearing awed voices whisper, &quot;It's that guy who has a blog.&quot;</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: dudes be worshipping me left and right</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i cant hardly walk down the street without stepping over torsos of the prostrate</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Navigating the urban landscape I'm sure is difficult enough without an obstacle course of deferential flesh and skyward asses.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Perhaps adapting the art of parkour to your unique environment would help?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah!</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i just give and fucking give</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Indeed, nary a jewel tumbles from your wishbox of daily exploits which I imagine does not sparkle.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh for fucks sake</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: youre just lobbying for me to play that dumb game</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: More than you know.</span>
