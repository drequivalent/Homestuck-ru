<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the seal on the bottle is unbroken</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: are you suggesting someone put piss in my apple juice at the factory</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: all im saying is don't you think monster howie mandel has the power to do something as simple as reseal a bottle?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: try using your brain numbnuts.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: why did the fat kid or whoever drank it know what piss tasted like</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i mean his reaction was nigh instantaneous</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it was the 15th day in a row howie mandel peed in his juice.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok i can accept that </span>
