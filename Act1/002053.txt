<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It seems expanding the dimensions of your room cost us some &quot;Build Grist&quot;.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But deploying the lathe did not appear to incur any expense.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It looks like certain objects are freebies, probably to help you set up the game.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wow, ok.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what do they do?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think it's up to you to find out.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: All I can do is drop stuff in your house, and move it around, apparently.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: how do i move stuff around? it sounds fun!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't think you can as the client. You will need to install the server application.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You should have received both in separate envelopes. I am running both on my computer right now.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what??</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Did you get another envelope in the mail?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Once you install the server and establish a connection, I'm sure you will be able to manipulate my environment in the same manner.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you sure you didn't get it?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh man.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i think i might know where it is.</span>
