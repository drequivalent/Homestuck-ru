<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm working on the bathroom.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But we are running low on Build Grist.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh man who cares about the bathroom, now there's a meteor heading for my house!!!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I see.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Do you suppose it has anything to do with the game?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i don't know, maybe! what do i do!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think it's very likely.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The walkthroughs vaguely suggest an impending threat before they end.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The already poorly constructed sentences become even more curt and ambiguous.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: As if written hastily and with a sense of alarm.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Actually, their dedication to updating the walkthrough under such circumstances is admirable.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wow, FASCINATING.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ??????</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: If the meteor is a game construct, I think the only thing to do is to proceed, and try to solve the dilemma on the game's terms.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Try using the lathe.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It says you can use the card on it, but isn't more specific than that.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok i'll do that.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Really, it is a labor to read this drivel.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: If I read any more my brain will need to be spoon-fed from a jar.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: While it blows spit bubbles in a highchair.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think I will write my own walkthrough.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That is, after we make sure you don't die.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: TT is breaking everything in my house.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: dude i told you to steer clear of that game</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and for that matter you should probably wash your hands of flighty broads and their snarky horseshit altogether</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and now there's a meteor coming, and i'm not even joking about that!!!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it's like a big asteroid or comet or something.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or just rhode island</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: theyre always throwing around these geographical comparisons to give us a sense of scale like it really means anything to us</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but its like it doesnt matter its always just like: WOW THATS PRETTY FUCKING BIG</span>
