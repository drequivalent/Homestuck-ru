<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that's an ugly rumor.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: whoever told you that is a filthy liar.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and you should probably stop hitting on him all the time or whatever.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I can't control myself. </span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I must have a weakness for insufferable pricks. </span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: anyway i still haven't checked the mail, my dad has it.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i'm trying to go get it from him, so brb</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You are typing to me right now while wearing something ridiculous.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no, why would you even think that??</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that's so stupid.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why don't you go get the game from your father?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: alright, wish me luck.</span>
