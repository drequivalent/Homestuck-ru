It is a STUFFED BUNNY. Much like the one <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scraps/dontmoveorthebunnygetsit.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">held hostage</a> briefly by Malkovich's Cyrus &quot;The Virus&quot; while taunting hard-luck protagonist Cameron Poe. And strikingly similar to the one scooped up from the soot of a burning Vegas strip by Cage's Poe and offered to his daughter, a gesture symbolic of a tattered exterior surrounding a heart of gold. Poe wasn't much to look at. But he was a good man.

But no, it is not merely LIKE that bunny. According to this NOTE OF AUTHENTICITY, it is the VERY SAME BUNNY.

This is so awesome.
