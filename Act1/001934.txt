You don't think the situation is quite dire enough to go all the way to &quot;RANCOROUS&quot;, but you still feel the PESTERCHUM client should reflect your mood change in some way.

&quot;BULLY&quot; will have to do. You guess.

This unsurprisingly does nothing whatsoever.

Oh, right, you forgot your chum is still pestering you.
