You order Hearts to drop his tub on the double before this fat lard puts you in a wheelchair.

If you take <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbuck</span> back to your own time and kill him there, that should save you the trouble of hunting him down. Might as well take <span style="color: #2ed73a">Stitch</span> too.

Maybe. You're not really sure if that's how it works. You don't really care though.
