Above, a spectator has appeared at the strike of 4 and has been giggling at your foolishness for a number of minutes.

<span style="color: #2ed73a">Clover</span> would have been tickled to help you open this vault! At the cost of answering a few of his clever TIME RIDDLES, needless to say.

If only you'd thought to seek his help first, rather than charging like the silly brute you are into this deadly trap of stable and not so stable time loops. Mostly unstable, really. These guys are way too dumb to maintain even elementary looping stability for more than a couple iterations.

If you weren't so preoccupied, <span style="color: #2ed73a">Clover</span> could tell you that you could use <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>'s help to pry anything out of a time loop, stable or otherwise. 

If you weren't so preoccupied, and if he weren't so dead! Hee hee hee!
