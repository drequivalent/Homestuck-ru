You check up on Slick's status. Slick says he killed <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar </span>again, <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbuck </span>twice, and <span style="color: #2ed73a">Stitch </span>once. You ask him if it was an alternate timeline <span style="color: #2ed73a">Stitch</span>. He says he guesses so. You say that doesn't count. You've got the real one here. He mutters some foul language you can't quite make out, but you tell him never mind and hurry down to meet you at the vault. 

He says he took some damage from <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sn</span>o<span style="color: #2ed73a">wman</span>. You say you know. You're having some EFFIGIES made of yourselves with your BACKUP HATS. Deuce brought Slick's crumpled BACKUP HAT which he wound up with somehow. Not sure what happened to Deuce's. Boxcars is obviously tied up at the moment, so you can't get your hands on his yet. 

Slick says he's got both their HATS and he'll be down ASAP. You say alright. He says in the meantime see what you can do about this eye.
