<span style="color: #2ed73a">Stitch</span> mutters to himself in his shop. He guesses <span style="color: #2ed73a">Eggs</span> and <span style="color: #2ed73a">Biscuits</span> are roughhousing again, because the fabric of spacetime is tearing something fierce on <span style="color: #2ed73a">Lord English</span>'s CAIRO OVERCOAT.
