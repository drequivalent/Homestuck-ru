Hang on. There's a tooth on the floor. You know that tooth. You've felt its bite before.

<span style="color: #2ed73a">Fin</span> was here. 

And judging by the forensics of the scene, the angle it hit the floor, the direction of the blood splatters and how dry the blood is, you think you know EXACTLY what he's about to pull.

Or more specifically, what he's about to already have pulled.
