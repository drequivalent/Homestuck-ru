If <span style="color: #2ed73a">Cans</span> shows up, none of these weapons you've got are going to do any good.

You admire the LANCE for a moment. It's a pretty sweet weapon with outstanding craftsmanship. At least you got something out of the eye-gouging. She'll have to pry this thing from your rigid severed arm if she wants it back.
