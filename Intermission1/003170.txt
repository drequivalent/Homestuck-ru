You chuck the LANCE at <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbuck</span>. 

But of course it's only a fleshwound. Seems like that's the only sort of wound you can ever inflict on the corpulent lummox.

Consequently you and he both jump to a random point on the timeline. This looks to be in the recent past, when <span style="color: #2ed73a">Stitch</span> and <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span> were setting up the crates for the imminent gunfight. Which was very thoughtful of them.

Your goons should be showing up any minute with the heavy firepower. For now you've got the drop on everybody.
