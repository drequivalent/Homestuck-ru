You follow Droog's simple instructions. So simple even a forgetful nincompoop like you can remember.

There's a BLOOD TRAIL on the floor that goes in a different direction than <span style="color: #2ed73a">Trace</span> went. You decide to follow it, because that sounds like a really good idea to you.

If there was something you were supposed to do after helping out Droog, you'll be damned if you remember what it was.
