<span style="color: #626262">PCG: OK I THINK I SET THIS UP RIGHT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: FUCK I SHOULD HAVE COME UP WITH A BETTER BOARD NAME.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE NAME IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SINCE THAT'S THE NAME THAT</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: UH</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: I ALREADY READ.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: WOW THAT PROBABLY WON'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ANYBODY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: WHATEVER, IT'S JUST A STUPID NAME, LET'S JUST DO THIS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: THIS IS A PUBLIC BULLETIN USING TROLLIAN'S WEIRD TRANSTIMELINE FEATURES WHICH I DON'T EVEN REALLY UNDERSTAND YET.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: BUT I'M GUESSING MIGHT BE USEFUL.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: I'VE INCLUDED ALL TWELVE PLAYERS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION LIST SO YOU SHOULD ALL BE ABLE TO READ THESE MEMOS AT ANY TIME.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: THAT IS, ALL THE MEMOS POSTED, PAST AND FUTURE. I THINK.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: IT COULD GET PRETTY TEMPORALLY CONFUSING OBVIOUSLY. I'M GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THE MEMOS AS SIMPLE AND LINEAR AS POSSIBLE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: ALSO LET'S KEEP THIS A ONE-WAY-ONLY BULLETIN TO MAKE THIS AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: DO NOT REPLY TO MY MEMOS!!! THIS IS NOT A FUCKING CHATROOM, ASSHOLES.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME IN RESPONSE TO A MEMO, MESSAGE ME IN PRIVATE AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT ON THE TIMELINE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS ABOUT THE TEAMS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: AS OF NOW, YOU SHOULD ALL BE AWARE THAT THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE TEAM, AND WE ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: AND BY &quot;NOW&quot; I MEAN TIME LOCAL TO ME AS OF WRITING THIS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: SO IF YOU'RE READING THIS IN THE PAST...</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: UH OK FIRST OF ALL, HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT THIS FEATURE ALREADY? SECOND WHY DIDN'T YOU FUCKING TELL ME.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: WHATEVER I DIGRESS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: IF YOU'RE READING THIS IN THE FUTURE THEN WHO CARES, IT'S PROBABLY OLD NEWS TO YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: ACTUALLY NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT READING THIS IN THE FUTURE?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: IT'S LIKE ANY BULLETIN BOARD, YOU POST STUFF AND IT SITS THERE FOR A WHILE AND PEOPLE IN &quot;THE FUTURE&quot; READ IT.</span>

<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; I'd like to add to this useless memorandum</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; That I still don't recognize the validity of your leadership</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: SWEET MOTHER GRUB'S OOZING VESTIGIAL THIRD ORAL SPHINCTER.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: HOW CAN YOU PEOPLE BE SO STUPID.</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; It may be true that we are all playing in the same session, but I see no reason to disband the former power structure</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; Especially if it means instituting a tactical midget with a short fuse, a foul mouth, and paralyzing insecurity over the color of his b100d</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; That's all I have to say</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: OH I HAVE A SHORT FUSE! THAT'S VERY FUNNY, YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR ME LAUGH OVER THE SOUND OF THE ROBOT YOU ARE PROBABLY BEATING TO DEATH.</span>

<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; Not usually</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: THE FUNNY THING IS IN THE FUTURE EVERYONE WILL RECOGNIZE ME AS THE UNDISPUTED LEADER, EVEN YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: YOU WILL BE STANDING ON THE TIPPYTOES OF YOUR IDIOTIC METAL SHOES, TAKING DELICATE PURCHASE OF MY NUBBY HORNS AND HOISTING YOURSELF OVER MY HEAD TO PUT YOUR SWEATIEST TOUGH GUY SMOOCH UPON MY TWITCHING SPINE LUMP.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: IT WILL BE TENDER AND DEFERENTIAL, LIKE A PAUPER KISSING A NOBLE'S RING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: JUST SCROLL DOWN, READ THE LOGS.</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; Nowhere have I seen evidence of this</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; Most of this is you from various points in time raving about nonsense and arguing with yourself</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; Do you realize that here in the future, this bulletin has come to be regarded as something of a joke</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; A lengthy piece of comedy, often quoted amongst ourselves in private moments of levity</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; It seems I'm the one to inform you of this up front</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; Which is likely why you persist with the ingratiating charade against better judgement</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: YOU'RE GETTING OFF ON THIS AREN'T YOU</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; What do you mean</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: THIS EXCITES YOU, BEING THE TOUGH GUY AND PRETENDING LIKE YOU'RE PUTTING THE AWESOME LEADER IN HIS PLACE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: YOU'RE PROBABLY WORKING UP A GOOD SWEAT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: HOPE YOU ALCHEMIZED A BUNCH OF SPARE TOWELS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: HEY WHY DON'T YOU &amp;&amp; THEM WITH YOUR SPONGEY BRAIN FOR EXTRA ABSORBENCY.</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; How do you know about my perspiration problem</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; I mean, aside from reading about it in this memo</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; Wait</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CCT: D --&gt; Fudgesicles</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG</span> banned <span style="color: #000056">CCT</span> from responding to memo.
