You try to be the white text guy, but fail to be the white text guy. No one can be the white text guy except for the white text guy.

The white text guy is known as <span style="color: #2ed73a">D</span><span style="color: white">o</span><span style="color: #2ed73a">c Scratch</span>.  

He is an officer of an indestructible demon known as  <span style="color: #2ed73a">L</span><img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/o.gif" border="0" /><span style="color: #2ed73a">rd English</span>. His job is to pave the way for the arrival of his master, who will be summoned upon the termination of the universe. He has worked at this task for many centuries, and will continue to do so until THE GREAT UNDOING.

<span style="color: #2ed73a">Scratch</span> is Alternia's FIRST GUARDIAN. Every planet destined for intelligent life has such an entity meant to protect it, and facilitate the planet's ultimate purpose. A first guardian is typically almost as old as the planet itself, and each has a unique, circuitous origin through the knots of paradox space. They can be born into a great diversity of forms, though they all share a common, especially potent genetic sequence. The code grants them near omnipotence, and when merged with a host of great intelligence, near omniscience as well.

What will he do?

It's up to him. All we can do is stand here.

And watch.
