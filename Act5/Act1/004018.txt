Over the course of your long journey, at one point you were fitted with a cool pair of robolegs. The guy who likes to build robots built them for you. 

But then, he does like to break them more than he likes to build them. It's usually why he builds them in the first place. 

Occasionally though, he will allow philanthropy to override misanthrobopy.
