<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Well?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Well what! I am surrounded 8y ghosts and kind of fre8king out a8out it!</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I know.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I'm asking what you intend to do about it.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I don't know, I guess I will just curl into a little 8all and cry and hope they go aw8y!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Is that what you want to hear you sick f8ck????????</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Aren't you going to kill her?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Who????????</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Your friend.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">The one who summoned the spirits.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Will that make them go away?</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Does it matter?</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">She brought them here to torment you. This obviously warrants revenge.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">You know you're going to anyway. You won't be able to help yourself.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I don't have to do shit!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: May8e I don't mind ghosts. May8e they'll 8e gr8 company once I get used to them!</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">No, they are terrifying you.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">There's only one thing to do.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Ok, so why don't YOU kill her! 8e my guest! Wow, thanks for offering. Wh8t a pal!</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">That's not how I work.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Oh really, well you seemed pretty excited a8out killing Tavros too.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And you even helped! So I guess that is how you work after all.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Not really.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">All I did was stand somewhere for a few minutes.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I just gave you an opportunity to do something you wanted to do anyway.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">You hated him, remember?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I know I did! I still do, I guess. I dunno.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut I was never gonna kill these people. They were like, off limits I guess?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: These games were just supposed to 8e fun and serve no other purpose!</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">They were serving a very important purpose.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah ok, you getting off on talking a girl into killing her 8uddies sure is important!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Los8r.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Again, I didn't talk you into anything, nor am I doing so now.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">You were, and are, going to do this regardless.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I only ever place myself into positions of tangential involvement with events that will bring about my employer's entry into this universe.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I oversee the events as they take place, and ever so slightly nudge them into motion when necessary.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I'm 8eginning to think you really 8elieve that! So delusion8l. You're just a path8tic, lonely gamer who 8uys into his own character profile 8S.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">The omniscient have no need for beliefs and no room for delusion.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Hahahahahahahaha!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You're the dum8est omniscient person I ever met.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Sure you know a lot, 8ut I know for a FACT there's stuff you don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">That's true.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">But the gaps in my knowledge exist by design.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">They are the pillars of shadow on which my comprehensive vision is built.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Necessary pockets of void meant to effectuate outcomes I've foreseen and which will require my influence.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Each dark pocket, in time, will be filled.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">But I wonder why I waste this nuance on you.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ecause you need to add more 8l8tant lies to patch up all the holes in your sad cover story.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I don't lie.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Deception is only necessary for those like you to achieve their objectives.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I play with my cards face up.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Isn't it funny how during our various matches, I can tell you what my moves will be in advance, and still win?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: ::::P</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah, 8ut I'm getting closer to 8eating you. You'll see.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Look at that. The short amount of time I have reserved for arguing with a child has expired.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I will go.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">But maybe you're right. Maybe you are a person with free will and you won't kill your friend.</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">What do I know?</span>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Enjoy your haunting.</span>
