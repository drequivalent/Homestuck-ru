<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; 100k, it isn't that difficult</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Try to be cognizant of your desires and needs</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; And attempt to regard those around you as simple vehicles meant to bring about your gratification</span>

<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; It really pleases me to hear tales of physical subjugation</span>
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; I presume these were lesser beings, toiling in the lower ranks of some hierarchy</span>
