<span style="color: #626262">CG: OK, MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD THEIR LOBE STEM CAUTERIZED ARE CAPABLE OF FEELING THE TWO PRIMARY EMOTIONS, HATE AND PITY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: PITY IS OF COURSE JUST THE TONED DOWN VERSION OF THE CENTRAL EMOTION, HATE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND ALL THE NUANCES OF PITY MANIFEST AS VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF FEELINGS LIKE WHATEVER CHEMICAL REACTIONS TRIGGER MATING FONDESS OR THE MYSTERIOUS FORCES THAT ARE BEHIND MOIRALLEGIANCE.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Karkat, holy fuck.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">CG: A WELL BALANCED PERSON IS IS GOING TO HAVE A GOOD DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN HATE AND THE VARIOUS PITY HUMORS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HAVING A GOOD BALANCE KEEPS ALL THE EMOTIONS SHARPER, SEE I THINK THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Oh????????</span>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: Hahahahahahahaha, you don't even know how much I'm laughing at this.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT SEE, YOU'RE TOO HEAVY ON THE HATE SIDE, OR AT LEAST YOU PRETEND TO BE WHICH IS MAYBE WORSE.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You aren't reading anything I say are you? You just want to talk and talk and talk.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND YOU THINK YOU'RE HATING UP EVERYONE HARD WHEN YOU'RE REALLY JUST BURNING OUT THAT ENTIRE EMOTIONAL HEMISPHERE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT'S LIKE LUKEWARM HATE. PRETENDER'S HATE, WITH NO COUNTERPOINT AT ALL.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AS SUCH THERE'S NO REAL SUBSTANCE TO YOUR HATE, IT'S LIKE A CARDBOARD MOVIE PROP.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">CG: OR MAYBE YOUR BROKEN BRAIN LED TO THE IMBALANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE, I DON'T KNOW.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHATEVER THE CASE IS, YOU'RE KIND OF EMOTIONALLY SCREWED, SORRY TO SAY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOUR HATE'S TOO DULL FOR A PROPER KISMESIS, IN MY OPINION.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND I DON'T SEE ANYONE CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO BE YOUR MOIRAIL HONESTLY, UNLESS THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO WOULD ACTUALLY BOTHER PITYING YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND LANDING A MATESPRIT? HAHAHAHA!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SERIOUSLY, LIKE THAT WOULD EVEN INTEREST YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BASICALLY ANY FEATURE OF YOUR EMOTIONAL PROFILE THAT USUALLY MAKES SOMEONE VIABLE IN THE REDROM DEPARTMENT MUST BE TOTALLY FRIED.</span>
