<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Fine.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then please at least try to sound more sarcastic when you do it.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Oh sure, I am really going to do that. Yes, very likely.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: ...</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then the Scratch will be implemented later, by either John or Dave I presume?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You used a male pronoun.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess it makes sense that it would happen later. My understanding is that Jack will not be banished from this session until near the end of the reckoning.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes, Jack will exit your session later, but this has nothing to do with the Scratch.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Not directly, as you imply.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't understand.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I thought that was the point of the Scratch, to open a rift in spacetime as it were, and banish him into the trolls' session.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">No.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">That is not the purpose of the Scratch at all. The Scratch does not open a rift in spacetime.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hmm.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then why have you directed me to cause it?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Does it have something to do with enabling you to die?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">No. Not directly.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">The Scratch has nothing more to do with my death than any other single event ultimately contributing to my demise.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think it's disingenuous for you to behave as if I have not been misled.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You say you don't lie, but what about lies of omission?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Lies of omission do not exist.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">The concept is a very human one. It is the product of your story writing again. You have written a story about the truth, making emotional demands of it, and in particular, of those in possession of it.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Your demands are based on a feeling of entitlement to the facts, which is very childish. You can never know all of the facts. Only I can.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">And since it's impossible for me to reveal all facts to you, it is my discretion alone that decides which facts will be revealed in the finite time we have.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">If I do not volunteer information you deem critical to your fate, it possibly means that I am a scoundrel, but it does not mean that I am a liar. And it certainly means you did not ask the right questions.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">One can make either true statements or false statements about reality. All of the statements I make are true.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Unless you're joking.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Haa haa, hee hee, hoo hoo?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Exactly.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then I guess I'll start asking better questions.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Good.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">I will make a Seer of you yet.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Will you?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">You can start by shoring up the reliability of your sources. You proceeded to question me believing you understood the purpose of the Scratch. You received your information about it from trolls. I assure you that in most ways, the trolls are as confused about everything as you are.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok. Noted.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What exactly does the Scratch do, then?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">It resets the game.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's it?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We all start from the beginning again? When John entered?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">No.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">The release of temporal energy will be quite massive.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">This is a hard reset. It will reboot the conditions in your universe well before you began playing the game.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">You will have lived different lives after the reset. The different initial conditions will ideally lead to a more favorable scenario in the new session.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Unfortunately, you will have no memory of anything that has happened in the session you are in now.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What will happen to us? Everyone in this session now?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">You will all cease to exist completely if you remain here during the Scratch.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This seems familiar.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It reminds me of when Dave and I were trapped in the doomed timeline, and he left to change the past.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The timeline ceased to exist, along with my dream self, who in a way became merged with my dream self of this timeline. I kept some of her memories.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is the situation similar?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Similar, but more severe.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Since this timeline will undergo such a violent upheaval, such a merger of memory cannot happen.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">You will be resigned to absolute oblivion.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Unless you can discover a way to preserve yourselves.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">But it's not really my place to advise you on that.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">After you have dealt with the Scratch and the sun, what happens to you is not any of my business.</span>
