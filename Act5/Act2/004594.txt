<span style="color: #008141">GA: Thats Why Youre Our Leader Karkat</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: NO, I'M YOUR LEADER BECAUSE OF MY INCREDIBLE TACTICAL SKILLS AND MY ABILITY TO MOBILIZE AND MOTIVATE A BUNCH OF USELESS PEOPLE TOWARD A COMMON GOAL, AND BECAUSE I'M EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS AND INTREPID. ALSO BECAUSE LEADERSHIP IS IN MY BLOOD. WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Statements Like That Are Also Why Youre Our Leader</span>

<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT SOUNDS SUITABLY DISDAINFUL.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I MEAN, IF A BUNCH OF ALIENS STARTED HASSLING YOU, YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO ACT REALLY HIGH AND MIGHTY, AND SUPERIOR IN EVERY WAY, RIGHT?.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHICH WE ARE, OF COURSE.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Uh Okay</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND NO, I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I WILL PROBABLY STEER CLEAR OF HER FOR THE MOST PART.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I HAVE MY SIGHTS SET ON THE JOHN HUMAN, AND PROBABLY ALSO THE JADE HUMAN, SHE'S A HUGE CULPRIT TOO.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Just</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Feels Really Silly When We Say Things Like The John Human In Confidence Amongst Ourselves</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WE HAVE TO COMMIT TO THIS. STAY IN CHARACTER, YOU KNOW?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: REMEMBER THE SPEECH.</span>

<span style="color: #008141">GA: Virtually Ensconced In The Fold Of My Personal Mythology</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: DID YOU WANT TO TROLL HER? ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING?</span>

<span style="color: #626262">CG: NO</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WELL THERE COULD BE</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WE CAN GAUGE YOUR RESULTS WITH THE &quot;FLIGHTY BROADS AND THEIR SNARKY HORSESHITOMETER&quot;.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: That Seems Just As Disparaging To Me As It Is To Her</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH WELL</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: USE IT AS MOTIVATION</span>
