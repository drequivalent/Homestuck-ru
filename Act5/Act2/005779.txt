<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Go on.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i was in this dark place surrounded by this big flock of crows</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: god this is so generically morbid</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im sorry in advance for exposing you to my unconscious minds retarded cliches</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's ok.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: They wouldn't be cliches if they didn't comprise the unanimously understood bedrock of phallic symbolism, with no other viable interpretation.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: well obviously i knew the birds were just black screaming sky dongs just hear me out</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i kept dying</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: there kept being these traps like i would go one way and get my head chopped off</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or go another way and get stabbed or whatever</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and every time i died the dream reset itself and i was standing there alive and ready to try to escape again</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but each time i would be watching myself from the vantage point of a different crow</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: like i was the crow all squawking around in circles like a macabre flapping douche</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and i would always watch myself try to do something different to dodge the trap but i always ended up dead</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hm.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Well, if I've learned anything from my extensive skimming over the Wikipedia articles on dream analysis,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's that this dream is very unlikely to have any literal significance whatsoever.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's probably not about dying at all.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you mean maybe its about anxiety over maintaining my blogs</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or that my beats might not be ill enough</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes. In fact, if you were on my couch that would have been my next question, as a licensed professional.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: &quot;Mr. Strider, have you considered that what you actually dread is to have your urban rhythms exposed for what they truly are, which is, clinically speaking, just shy of 'da bomb'?&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and then we crack up laughing cause we both know theyre fresher than your moms change of drawers and tighter than when shes wearin them</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Listening to you conjure imagery of my mother in her underpants is definitely keeping us buoyed high above this swirling Freudian hellhole.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Well done.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: please its not like shes my mom i can visualize her choice ass all i want without it gettin much more than moderately uncomfortable for everyone involved</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What if you're wrong?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: about what</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Her not being your mother.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: uh</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Don't worry, you're probably safe. Luckily I can think of no literary or historical precedent for that sort of folly whatsoever.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: this isnt the first time youve insinuated were related what is up with that</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Isn't it?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i mean</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im not sure</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i feel like youve brought it up before which is kind of weird but now i dont know</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i think im getting this weird deja vu thing where i was sure we talked about this</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: forget it</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why don't you tell me more about your dream?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so i kept dying and kept being crows and stuff</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and then i started to notice something coming from the sky</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it was this faint eerie singing and i look up and theres nothing there just darkness</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's interesting.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've read about this.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what did you read</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Certain texts say singing from the unknowable void carries a message.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That its recipient has been selected for a mission of supreme cosmic importance, that will result in your death and that of billions more.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But one that is essential to the perpetuation of existence itself.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what the fuck sort of crackpot psychology text would say something like that</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's not from a psychology text.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so then youre consulting astrology books now</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Not astrology.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: More like,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Zoology.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh my fucking god will you put that away</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Keep describing the dream, though.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: If the rest of it is incompatible with prognoses of the zoologically dubious, I will withdraw my insinuation.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: theres not even much more to it</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i looked up into the sky</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: didnt see anyone singing</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but even though the sky was black i could see the sun</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it was bright as hell even through my shades</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so i flapped my wings and flew up away to it like a fucking piece of garbage</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and thats it</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This doesn't strike you as an impulse of self destruction?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: not in the sense that it was a dark sacrificial zoology mission</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it was more like somewhere to go besides watching myself die a lot from the vantage of a feathery murder of dumb shitty birds</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So, if hypothetically you were to accept such a mission, or even insist upon one, it wouldn't be in the spirit of genuine sacrifice, but of escape?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what the fuck are you talking about</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok somethings wrong</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: this whole conversation is falling apart this isnt how it originally went at all</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Aw. We were making good progress, too.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why did you have to go and remember?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: this happened months ago</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: does this mean im dead</span>
