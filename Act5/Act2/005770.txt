<span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: RIGHT THERE, WHILE JACK WATCHED LIKE A FUCKING CREEP.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT IT WORKED.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: omg, karkat. it is like your shitty shipping grid is coming true before our very eyes.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: haha, remember when you made that ugly thing?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT SHIPPING, OR MY LUDICROUS STRANGLEHOLD OVER ALL TOPICS CONCERNING ROMANCE, I'M STILL TALKING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HE WOKE UP ALIVE ON DERSE, AND MET WITH ROSE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THAT WAS THE END OF THE LINE FOR ALPHA DAVE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE, HE DOESN'T TIME TRAVEL AFTER THAT, AND HE AND ROSE STAY ON DERSE WAITING FOR THE BOMB UNTIL YOU START THE SCRATCH. BUT I CAN'T SEE EITHER OF THEM BECAUSE OF THE BLACKOUT LINGERING AROUND ROSE FOR WHATEVER REASON. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S UP WITH THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: REGARDLESS, HIS JOB IS TO PLOT A COURSE THROUGH THE RING TO FIND THE SUN.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHEN HE DOES, EITHER HE OR ROSE WILL DELIVER THE BOMB.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I DON'T KNOW WHICH.</span>
