<span style="color: #626262">?CG: THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WHICH I BELIEVE NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE HERE AND NOW, SO YOU WILL BOTH SHAPE YOUR SHIT UP AND PERHAPS BEGIN TO APPROXIMATE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EXCRUCIATINGLY RETARDED.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">?CG: OUR ROMANCE IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE JOKE THAT PASSES FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: YOU ONLY HAVE ONE QUADRANT! THAT'S JUST ABSURD.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: right</span>

<span style="color: #626262">?CG: THESE PSYCHO GIRLS HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN EACH OF YOU KILLED AT LEAST ONCE TO MY KNOWLEDGE.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: well, yeah...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: but terezi killed me in an alternate timeline, so that isn't too bad i guess.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: plus, i am pretty sure that she is sorry about it.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: OH GOD, YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT?</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: sounds like a loudmouth inferiority thing going on here to me</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: like you dont want to acknowledge that your troll ladies find a couple of human dudes irresistible</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: YOU DON'T GET IT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS MUCH AS IT MAKES ME SICK TO MY VARIOUS BITS OF ALIEN PHYSIOLOGY YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF, THESE GIRLS ARE CLEARLY FLIRTING WITH BOTH OF YOU PRETTY HARD.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE SWEPT YOU BOTH INTO THEIR SICK ASSASSINATION GAMES IS SADLY WHAT MAKES THIS OBVIOUS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: wait...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: are you saying that vriska is interested in me?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: like, romantically?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: EGBERT JUST EARNED A FEW BRAIN POINTS!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: HE HAS REACHED A NEW RUNG ON HIS ECHELADDER, &quot;EASILY OUTFOXED BY SIMPLE UTENSILS&quot;</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: yeah ok</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: but i mean</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: anything more than that</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: like</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: if earth wasnt destroyed and she werent in some other universe on a planet full of unspeakable frothing dipshits</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: and she was on earth visiting your town or something</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: would you want to ask her to go see one of your dumbass movies</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: like the new maconnohey jam where he smirks and like all but deliberately draws the audiences ire like a goddamn magnetron</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: mcconaughey!!!!!!!!</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: i mean, yeah, sure it would be fun to do something like that with her, i think.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: but...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: beyond that, it's a little confusing!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: i don't think i have ever actually liked a girl before in that way, so i am not really sure what i am supposed to feel or do...</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: HOLY FUCK WHAT AM I EVEN READING HERE?????</span>

<span style="color: #626262">?CG: ARE YOU QUITE DONE SLOGGING THROUGH THE EMOTIONAL MORASS OF ADOLESCENCE, EMERGING FROM THE SLUDGE IN YOUR JUNIOR ECTOBIOLOGY WADERS?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: ARE WE FEELING JUST A LITTLE BIT WISER? DID WE GROW TODAY? THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: YOU WOULD THINK WARNING YOU GUYS THAT FRATERNIZING WITH THESE FEMALES IS PUTTING YOUR LIVES IN DANGER WOULD BE ENOUGH.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: REALLY, DANGER YOU SAY? OH GOODNESS, WE NEARLY MADE A HUGE MISTAKE! WHY THANK YOU, MR. TROLL, HOW GRACIOUS OF YOU TO ALERT US TO OUR FOOLISHNESS.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: you just sound kinda bitter</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: did one of the human ladies reject you</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: OF COURSE NOT.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: how did it go did you stand in a quadrant like you were playing four square</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: holding a bucket full of flowers or slime or whatever and jade was like no thanks bro</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: is that how it went down</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: YES, YOU FIGURED IT OUT! YOU ARE A SAVANT OF XENOBIOLOGY DAVE AND I SALUTE YOU WITH ONE OF MY MANY INTERGALACTIC SPACE TENDRILS</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: (THAT'S FAKE, I MADE THAT UP TO FUCK WITH YOU)</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: or maybe it was a guy who rejected you</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: FUCK OFF.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: see how i look right now thats a poker face might want to take some notes</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: I SEE NOTHING BUT A COWARD BEHIND DARK EYEWEAR CLEARLY DESIGNED FOR WOMEN AND A PAIR OF IMPUDENT LIPS PURSED SO TIGHT IT'LL SOUND LIKE AIR SQUEALING OUT OF A BALLOON WHEN I PUNCH YOU IN THE GUT.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: oh god stop talking about my lips thats the second time</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: ok youre clearly gay and youve probably got some issues about it dude</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: john just a heads up in the future i think youre gonna spurn one of his awkward advances</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: uh oh!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: JOHN DON'T LISTEN TO THIS FUCKER, HE'S THE WORST GUY AT GIVING ADVICE I'VE EVER SEEN.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: yeah, i dunno dave, i have talked to karkat a lot and i really don't think he has a thing for me.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: EXACTLY. JOHN ONCE AGAIN IS FLYING HIGH AS SMARTEST HUMAN.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: AND JOHN, PURELY HYPOTHETICALLY, IF ONE OF US IN THE FUTURE DOES MAKE SOME SORT OF SOLICITATION YOU DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND...</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: BECAUSE OF PERHAPS SOME CULTURAL DIFFERENCES</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: I MEAN NO ONE IN PARTICULAR HERE</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: MAYBE TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT PERSON MIGHT NOT BE THINKING TOO CLEARLY AT THAT MOMENT</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: uh...</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: IT MIGHT BE THE CASE THAT THIS PERSON HAS GOTTEN TOO WRAPPED UP IN A SORT OF CALIGINOUS IDEAL</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: AND GET CARRIED AWAY, POSSIBLY SO MUCH SO THEY WERE BLIND TO HOW COMPLETELY FUCKED UP AND WEIRD IT WOULD BE TO PURSUE ANYTHING LIKE THAT WITH ANOTHER SPECIES</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: ESPECIALLY ONE THAT DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF A CALIGINIOUS RELATIONSHIP</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: what</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: the fuck</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: are you talking about</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: BUT I'M NOT THAT PERSON. I HAVE A FIRM GRASP ON HOW DERANGED AND UNNATURAL ANY SORT OF INTERSPECIES RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE, WHETHER CALIGINOUS OR CONCUPISCENT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: SO I ASK</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: NO I'M FUCKING BEGGING YOU BOTH</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: TO QUIT CHATTING UP THESE SHITHIVE BROADS AND LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: thats obviously not gonna happen</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: FUCK.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: LOOK.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: ALRIGHT I ADMIT THIS ISN'T PURELY MAGNANIMOUS CONCERN FOR YOUR SAFETY HERE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: WE'RE ALL SORT OF COOKING UP A PLAN RIGHT NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: MY RIGHT NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL, MAY, AND I DO STRESS MAY, END UP WITH ALL OF US MEETING FACE TO FACE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO AVOID IF AT ALL POSSIBLE</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: IS TO HAVE THIS RENDEZVOUS INSTANTLY DETERIORATE INTO A LOT OF REVOLTING TROLL/HUMAN SLOPPY MAKEOUTS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: THAT WOULD JUST RUIN IT FOR ME, OK?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: REALLY THE ONLY SCENARIO THAT I AM SURE WOULD CAUSE ME TO REGRET SUCCESS. GOT IT?</span>
