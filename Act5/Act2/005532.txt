<span style="color: #b536da">TT: How can I see through it?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">It seems you weren't listening, so I will state this again in the form of a question.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Don't you think I should be asking the questions from now on?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes, if you wanted to be disingenuous and irritating.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Don't you think a clever person should be able to acquire information from someone who only asks questions?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then it's a challenge!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I pass.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Do you have a choice? What if I'm feeling a bit stubborn?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok, so what you mean is I should continue humoring your leading questions until you happen to ask certain rhetorical questions that contain information I need.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Was that a question?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That was a fact, and then a period.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">How does a Seer see?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: ...</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: With a crystal ball?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I already considered that. I don't think I can get the focus of the ball to &quot;zoom in&quot; tight enough on the cue ball's enclosure to read the answers.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">How else does she see?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: By other magical means, I guess.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Should I use magic?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Do you believe in magic?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Magic is real.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've been using it.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Are you sure?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Use whatever word you want to describe it. I have magic wands, they are very powerful, and they allow me to be magic. Your questions are silly.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">What makes you convinced the wands are responsible for your abilities?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Because I did not have the abilities before I made them.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Could this be circumstantial?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Could it?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Is there an echo?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is there an echo?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Hee hee?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't know what you're getting at.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: How about another leading question?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">What did you combine to make those wands?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Some stuff.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Knitting needles?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">An inexpensive figurine of some fictional fellow with long whiskers?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">A simple textbook on the zoologically dubious?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Why would this mundane combination of objects grant a child such an alarming mastery over dark forces all at once?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm guessing this is one of the rhetorical questions meant to be informative.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So then, my answer should affirm how ridiculous that sounds, shouldn't it?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Maybe?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That wasn't even a question.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes it was?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok. Magic is fake, the wands are useless toys, and there is something else going on. Next question???</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Would it be so difficult to believe the power you've found to devastate your planet and create shortcuts through your session is not entirely by your own device?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Would it be so difficult to believe a young lady could be unwittingly apprenticed by more powerful entities who meant her potential to be realized later through some arbitrary trigger?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">What would you say if I said a dutiful girl raised in the daylight was protected by a bulb-headed guardian, and learned to glow in the dark after death?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">What would you say if I said a vengeful boy on a path of nihilism was taken under the wings of fearsome angels, and learned to destroy hope with their light?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">What would you say if I said a reserved girl enamored by what dwelt in shadow was selected by the horrorterrors for service, and did their bidding at every step while convinced of her own autonomy?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What would I say to those short fables?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Not much, except I gather the third is a story about me, and that there's a lesson you'd like me to take from it.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That I should renounce my &quot;allegiance&quot; before my grimdark corruption is absolute.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And while I'm at it, I should discard these useless wands, because apparently the power was in my little black heart all along. Is that right?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Won't you have to give up your specibus to the one who causes the Scratch regardless?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">How else will the young man wield that great big needle?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't know! If you say so.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Haven't your friends already shown concern for your recklessness and your increasing sense of detachment from the party, the team objectives, and not to mention those of your personal quest?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Does this worry you? Is there a part of you left that's able to worry?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes. It has been mysteriously localized to my middle finger. Could the dark magics be at work AGAIN?!</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Do you deny that you have been neglecting incoming messages from your teammates? Would that be in keeping with the spirit of the human emotion of friendship for one whose soul was not so befouled by the designs of unknowable monstrosities?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Friendship isn't an emotion, numbnuts.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Isn't it, Rose?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Isn't it?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've been busy. I'll get back to them.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And can we please stop doing the patronizing question thing?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: In exchange I promise I will discontinue my patronizing responses.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Can the omniscient be patronized?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The omniscipotent can do whatever they please. I guess I'm just asking you nicely to do me this favor.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Very well. I will stop smothering you with surprise noodles.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Huh?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">But only because I find you to be adorable.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So creepy.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">So cute.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yuck.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">I am going to ask the same question I asked earlier.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Please do not regard it as a violation of my pledge. It is just an ordinary question, like those that crop up in an ordinary conversation.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">How does a Seer see?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Be literal.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: With her eyes?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Take the orb.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Ask it a question.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't know what to ask anymore.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm confused.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">What would you ask me?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I would ask what should I do next.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Then ask.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What should I do next?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Not me.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">The ball, dunkass.</span>
