<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: can you be more specific?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: well</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: basically im from another timeline</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: we couldnt win the game there so i came back to help dave</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: dave?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: dave from this timeline</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: as a sprite im supposed to help him with his quest</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: oh yeah</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: im supposed to help jade too, but......</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: *sniffle*</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: shes doing alright dont worry about it</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: ok, ill try...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: you were saying?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: so things kind of became even more crazy in this timeline than the one i was from</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and it was clear dave was never gonna do the quest i didnt get the chance to finish</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: not even after you brought the forge</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: the forge?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: your volcano</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: ohhh</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: so</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: after laying low for a while</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i just went and did whatever i could myself</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: got caledfwlch</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: the fuckin welsh sword dave broke</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: went to look for hephaestus again</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: figuring there wasnt much hope in beating him this time either especially being injured and all but what the hell right</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but then</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: thats when you lit the forge somehow</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: i did?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: well no</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: not you other jade</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: yeah</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: shes a lot more brave than me i think</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: she brought me back thinking i could help her and all i did was disappoint her and everyone else</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: you came back as a sprite and youre managing to do important things...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: but i just feel so scared and helpless</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: sounds like you came back because jade made the decision for you</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i made the decision to come back myself maybe itd be different if you had the same chance</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: i dont know if i would have if i had the chance</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: but i would like to not feel so useless to everybody</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i think everyones on top of this</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: theres not much for us to do anymore</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: what about your sword? isnt it important?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i guess so</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but not really for me since im not the real dave anymore</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: im still not sure how you got it...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: what does it have to do with my volcano?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: thats a bit complicated</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: see it turns out</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i had no idea how the denizens worked at all</span>
