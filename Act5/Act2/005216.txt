<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ok, i will try this</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: heheh, look at this handsome guy here, hiding in the woods and being sneaky</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: he looks frozen solid too</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: so if i go bother him later, that means if i try to take him now i will only get slime right???</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes That Should Work</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Make A Note Of The Coordinates</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: When You Travel To Interact With Your Cloned Subjects You Are Also Taking The Opportunity To Explore And Discover New Habitats</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: As Well As New Species Of Frogs For Your Terminal To Track</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Its Efficient To Go Adventuring In This Fashion While You Are Waiting For Your Young Clones To Mature</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: that sounds like fun!!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes Its A Lot Of Fun</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Is Also Extremely Time Consuming</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Unlike Some Appearifiers In The Veil This One Is Locked To The Present Moment</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: You Cannot Use It As A Window Into The Future Or Past And Isolate Frogs Whose Futures Are Certain And Therefore Most Paradoxifiable</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Means Of Expedition Are Limited</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Suppose You Could Use Time Travel To Accelerate The Process</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But You Would Need To Establish Weeks Worth Of Stable Time Loops</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Think It Would Be An Overly Elaborate And Dangerous Undertaking Personally And Anyone Who Would Attempt Such A Thing Is Reckless</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Wouldnt Advise It</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: hmmmmm</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: k hang on while i clone this fella.....</span>
