<span style="color: #b536da">TT: They've revealed some of their secrets to me already, and given me a few errands to run.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This is why you might have observed some unusual behavior from me.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh shit youre kidding</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no really are you serious i didnt even notice</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: fuck mind = blown</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm doing my part, but they have a mission for you as well.</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: No.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Something a little more astronomical.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Like a star chart with no stars.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hence the challenge.</span>
