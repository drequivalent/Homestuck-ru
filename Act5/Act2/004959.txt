<span style="color: #a15000">AT: uH,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: wHOOOPS,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It was so em8arrassing just reading that Tavros. I'm em8arrassed!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I am actually feeling genuine em8arrassment. Your o8scene incompetence is actually polluting my otherwise pristine composure. Nice going!</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: sO,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: i DON'T CARE,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Jade let you down too easy. She's too nice! Someone's got to tear into you for that appalling display, and once again, guess who's shoulders that falls on?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: That's right. Vriska's, as usual.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: i THINK SHE HAS THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF NICENESS, pERSONALLY,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: aN AMOUNT THAT IS SOME, iNSTEAD OF,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: nONE,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Hey, I'm nice when it matters, and where it doesn't strangul8te the critical development of people I give a shit a8out, ok?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Really I don't know what you see in her. She is completely useless, like you.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: W8, of course!!!!!!!! It makes perfect sense. You and she represent the ideal matespritship, how could I have 8een so 8lind!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Two perfectly pointless gru8s in a bucket.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: nO, i HAVE TOO MUCH SELF CONFIDENCE NOW TO BE UPSET BY YOUR SCANDALOUS IMAGERY,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: i DON'T THINK SHE IS USELESS,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: aND i DON'T THINK i AM EITHER,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: bECAUSE OF NEW SELF ESTEEMS OBTAINED, rEMEMBER,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Oh will you please stop going on a8out your fucking self esteem.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I will say this much a8out her, she was right a8out that. How insuffera8le can you get, prattling on and on a8out how confident you are.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Tavros, you give confidence a 8ad name. I gave you all the chances in the world to earn it, to earn REAL confidence, and you failed.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You couldn't even do the one little thing I asked you to! The one thing that would have made you man up once and for all.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So instead you flew away and cried, and decided to sleep away your sorrow for the rest of the adventure.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Do you have any idea how sick that made me? Everything a8out you makes me sick.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: When you talk a8out your self confidence, I throw up a little. You don't know what confidence is. Ro8o-legs don't give you confidence, that 8n't no more true than saying my ro8o-arm gave me mine. See what I mean?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Your confidence is faker than even the great Rufio himself, Lord of the Unreal. It's pure fiction, a false fakey fraudy con jo8 from a wimpy loser charlatan 8ullshit artist.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It's shallow and nause8ting, just like you. Do us all a favor and SHUT UP a8out it.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: oK, i THINK,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: tHIS IS ACTUALLY MAKING ME PRETTY MAD,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah right!!!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I'll 8elieve that when I see it, chump.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: i DON'T WANT YOU TO MOCK ME ANYMORE,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: i DON'T KNOW IF MY CONFIDENCE IS REAL, oR WHAT,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: bUT i WOULD LIKE YOU TO STOP SAYING STUFF LIKE THAT TO ME,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: aND TO STOP SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT MY FRIEND JADE, tOO,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Jade is an idiot.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: A useless, 8oring no8ody. What has she done for her party other than fuck up every step of the way? What does she ever do 8ut take naps and get in trou8le?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: She's awful, and you deserve each other. Oh w8, except she h8tes you!!!!!!!! Ahahahahahahahaha. Even the 8oring pointless girl h8s you, talk a8out a guy who can't get a 8r8k.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Though I guess she's not compleeeeeeeetely useless. ::::)</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: wHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Ok, Tavros, I gave her credit for something, so I'll give you credit for something too.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Your plan to control her lusus really wasn't a 8ad idea!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And using your a8ility to &quot;save her life&quot; (lol) was a pretty good way to test how effective your powers are across sessions.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Pretty good way to practice, to know where you stand!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Practicing your a8ilities is important, so when it comes down to using them for something that really matters, you know you're ready for prime time.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I know this first hand.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I got lots and lots and LOTS of practice with your little guinea pig friend. ::::D</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So really, turns out she wasn't so useless at all! Far from it.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: wHOA, wHAT,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: aRE YOU SAYING YOU DID TO HER,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Not really the point!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: The point is I'm trying to pay you a compliment.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: At this point, you are so sad and disgusting, you should treat anything nice anyone has to say a8out you like a chest full of shimmering 8oon8ucks.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: oKAAAY, gOD,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: wHAT,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Like I said! Your plan was solid.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Controlling the guardian to go after Jack was a fine idea. Sure would stir some shit up! 8etter than 8eing an insignificant stuttering piece of trash all the time, I say.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And you were definitely on to something a8out doing it &quot;irregardless&quot; (lol) of her wishes.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ecause it's for her own good! That's what winners do. They do what is right for someone they care a8out even if the other person does nothing 8ut 8itch and moan and act ungr8ful a8out it. 8etter you learned l8 than never.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: In fact, I would go as far as saying that if you went ahead with her plan against her wishes, it MIGHT just earn you a smidgen of respect from me.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: We'll see.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: There's really just one catch.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: oH,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">AT: wHAT'S THAT,</span>
