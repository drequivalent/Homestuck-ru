<span style="color: #e00707">TG: for future reference</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's true.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Your outburst was pretty sweet though.</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So, whenever you like.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: As long as conventionally speaking, it's quite soon.</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Sure.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And if you have trouble going to sleep, maybe you can ask your patron troll to trick the telepathic one into putting you to sleep again.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Each of us seems to have a troll infatuated with helping us. Haven't you noticed?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What about the psychopath who's currently helping you?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh yeah terezi</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no shes cool</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Isn't that camaraderie blossoming into some sort of interspecies whatever?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: its blossoming into an interspecies partnership in incredibly shitty cartooning</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what do you mean get her to trick someone into putting me asleep again</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: when did that happen</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Just now.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: who did that</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That would be John's patron troll.</span>
