<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i just didn't really have any idea that you had any sort of feelings like that, so i am kind of caught off guard.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hey, i don't have a problem with your weird sort of alien hate-love thing!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it is just that, uh...</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: like, i dunno.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: going on weird fight dates and beating the crap out of each other, and being in hate-love or love-hate.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: isn't that how it works?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU ARE SUCH AN IGNORAMUS I COULD SHIT MILES OF RAGE SNAKE TO CHOKE YOU TO DEATH.</span>
