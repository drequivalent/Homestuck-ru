<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, if you do not have any objection...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: maybe later, i will drop by your planet again and rescue you, thus breaking the spooky spell put on you by your nefarious, shadowy masters.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Swoon!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that way you will stop being so grimdark and ominous, and basically completely off the deep end in every way, as is now painfully obvious to anyone with a brain.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I will do by best to occupy myself as benignly and unmagically as possible until you show up.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yes.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: please write some happy stories in your journal, about lively horses, and conspicuously not about wizards, or sadness.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: ... &quot;Happy?&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What is this strange, unsad emotion of which you speak?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yes, this is good.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: you see rose, these are jokes.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: this are what they look like, do not be alarmed.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Jokes?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are those the things people say when they want unusual noises to come out of the pliable crescent-shaped holes sometimes found in people's faces?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: laughs, rose. laaaughs.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: also, those crescenty looking holes where laughs come out of?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: those are smiles!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: observe... :D</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I need to make a note of this.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Excuse me while I open this tome bound in the tanned, writhing flesh of a tortured hellscholar. The screaming will subside shortly.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, i will wait patiently.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Continue to not be alarmed as I record your advice with runes stroked in the black tears bled from the corruption-weary eyes of fifty thousand imaginary occultists.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And then brace yourself for the fabled blackdeath trance of the woegothics I will slip into, while quaking in the bloodeldritch throes of the broodfester tongues.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no, rose!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that sort of nonsense is exactly what is out of the question!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i see things are more urgent than i realized.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i will have to venture there straightaway, and slap you right out of that silly old trance!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: One is not easily shaken from the broodfester tongues, John.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: They are stubborn throes.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well shit.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Besides, you can't come to my planet right away.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You will need to recover the treasure first, because it must be delivered to me.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what is this treasure, anyway?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and how's it gonna save us!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You'd probably be disappointed if I described it.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: tell me anyway!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's called </span><span style="color: #000000">The Tumor</span><span style="color: #b536da">.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: you're right, that is the shittiest sounding treasure i have ever heard.</span>
