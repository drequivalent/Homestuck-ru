You once again try to be <span style="color: #2ed73a">D</span><span style="color: #ffffff">o</span><span style="color: #2ed73a">c Scratch</span>, and fail spectacularly. You can't be him no matter how hard you try. It is impossible.

[<span style="color: #ffffff">In fact, I think it would be for the best if I commandeered the narrative completely for a while. I trust you won't mind if I speak in white. It's not actually negotiable, but as a courtesy I will enclose my words between a pair of visually audible brackets.

I am doing this because I can.</span>]
