<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah i saw my future self fighting him so obviously that had to happen or else id be dead anyway</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: without even getting the satisfaction of standing up to him</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So was your decision a result of desire or obligation?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: hard to explain</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: with all the time shit going on</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i dont try to understand your light shit do i</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't know much about the Light Shit, to be honest.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I may have missed my chance to figure it out.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: havent we had this conversation already</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Mostly.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm doing what I can to jog your memory.</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So what about Jade?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You didn't tell her your expedition with her would result in your death, let alone one she'd inadvertently cause.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Or that she'd be stuck with the job of resuscitating you. Did you?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what am i really supposed to say</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: hey were gonna hunt frogs til you shoot me through the jack</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: then i die and youve got to make out with me</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: that kind of changes how the whole thing goes doesnt it</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Not if you're &quot;supposed to,&quot; right?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what does that even mean</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess you're right. No reason to make an effort to empathize if doing so comes at the price of oblivion.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: wtf</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It must be comforting to have your ASPD tacitly supported by predestination.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: aspd</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Antisocial personality disorder.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh no</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: this conversation just got bumrushed by a mudslide of fucking awful</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It wasn't already awful, believing you might be dead?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you dont know anything</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: about what i was feeling or what happened on lofaf</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you were all pavement faced and babbling your throefester speak and flipping off the shit with your own crazy deathwish thing why do you think you know what was going through my head</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: youre just assuming and throwing around psyche buzzwords like aspd complex disorder</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So it's a disorder, a complex, and then a disorder again for good measure?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: in your case probably</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Sounds like a positively delirious state of existence.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: its some delirious biznasty alright</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh... snap?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yes ima authorize a GOD DAMN you may swipe it at the door to check yourself into the burn ward</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Might you loosen the purse strings on an &quot;Oh no he didn't?&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: nah those are kept in emergency reserve for yo mama jokes from the 90s</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: anyway</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im telling you if i said anything at all about it she probably doesnt even fire her gun once and all im doing is dragging her into a doomed timeline with me</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess I'm learning to be impressed by your sense of obligation to inevitable misfortune. It's a strange case of inspiration through futility.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: none of this is that big a deal</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i just mentioned the basics to her</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: that id stop time traveling soon</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: break out of the loops</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: not have to wonder all the time if i was taking a wrong turn and dooming everybody</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i was never that cool with this</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: With what, exactly?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you know how you turned out to be this incredibly shitty seer of light and basically failed at that in every way imaginable</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hey!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: well maybe i never wanted to be a knight of time</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: maybe id rather just be like</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the dave of guy</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you know just some dude</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: These really do not sound like the words of someone ready to face his own death.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The kind you don't wake up from, I mean.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i guess not</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: guess i failed my quest then</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: to nobody in particular i guess</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The unseen bitches callously conspiring to expect greatness from you?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yes those exact bitches</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: If that's how you feel,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then why did you insist on going on the mission to deliver</span> <span style="color: white">T</span><span style="color: black">h</span><span style="color: white">e</span> <span style="color: black">T</span><span style="color: white">u</span><span style="color: black">m</span><span style="color: white">o</span><span style="color: black">r</span><span style="color: #b536da">?</span>
