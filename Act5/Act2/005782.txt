<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: excuse me, alien time troll, but i am TRYING to wrap a present.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: really, you all have the worst timing.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yes, I can see that. Two ugly garments, and seeds for some kind of strange earth vegeta8le? Pretty lame present, John!!!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: nope, not going to ask how you know my name, or what i'm sending, don't care.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: and one of these ugly garments is for me, also, it's not ugly, it's awesome.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Not as awesome as something you will 8e wearing later, thanks to me.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: uh oh, my mouse is hovering dangerously close to the block button!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: it always does that when i talk to trolls, it is the dangdest thing.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Calm down, I just thought I would foreshadow my existence to you at this quaint moment on your timeline.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It is way too tempting not to let you know I have taken gr8 care to 8ecome a very important feature of your life.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Or for that matter, to let you know that I will 8e giving you a present so much 8etter than the useless crap you're shoving in that 8ox.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I will 8e giving you the gift of immortality!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: oh sweet, that has been on my wish list, ranking just below a mint condition little monsters poster, starring hollywood superstar, howie mandel.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: can i expect it to arrive on my next birthday??</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yes, as a matter of fact. Nice guess!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It will come at a cost though.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: the mandel poster, or immortality?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: The latter, jackass!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: In order for you to claim it, you will have to 8e quite gulli8le and allow me to arrange your murder.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i see, here is where all the sick trolling begins!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: you can keep your present, i am not interested.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut you will 8e! You will happily go along with everything I tell you to do.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And then, once I have completely earned your trust, I will kill you John. ::::)</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: sigh...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: the other troll i just talked to was way better, if a tad grumpy, at least she was down with talking about cool movies, sort of.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut this is all true. I've seen it already. You have no idea how delicious the dramatic irony is right now!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You will die. I will lead you into a trap, and watch you 8leed to death on a 8ig stone sla8 with a sword stuck in your chest.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: There is nothing you can do a8out it. In fact, it has already happened!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: that's nice. now scram, troll!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I'll leave you alone soon enough.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I was just feeling pretty pleased with myself, a8out all the 8rilliant plans I made for you and your friends.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Stopping 8y in your past to mess with your head is really just a courtesy, 8ecause I like to think we're pretty good friends 8y the time I get around to killing you. ::::D</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: ok, you got me!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: my feathers are all ruffled, and i can no longer tell my ass apart from a big orange earth vegetable!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: now can you leave me alone?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I guess so.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut my inevita8le grisly murder of you notwithstanding, you're a pretty fun guy to hassle. It'll 8e difficult sparing you from the privilege of my company until your game 8egins.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: that is basically the worst pickup line i have ever heard.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Please, John. As if there is any conceiva8le sequence of events which could lead me to consider you as a via8le romantic partner, in any quadrant. Even the pale ones.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: blurp durp bluh, more plausible alien sounding things.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: weren't you leaving?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: ok then...</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I mean, I was going to.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut now I guess I'm not.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: oh.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: why?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ecause this isn't really happening.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: it isn't?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It did, once.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut now it's just a memory.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I guess I must 8e dead.</span>
