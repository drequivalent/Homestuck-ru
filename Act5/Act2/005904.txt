<span style="color: #626262">PCG: AND LEAVING ME DISTURBING NOTES.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: I'M SURE OTHERS MUST BE DEAD BY NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: AND NOW SOLLUX IS BLIND AND I LOST TRACK OF HIM SOMEHOW.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: I HEARD A STRAY HONK AND I RAN AND WE GOT SEPARATED AND</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: I'M STARTING TO THINK</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: THAT THIS MUST BE A DOOMED TIMELINE</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: THAT'S WHY I CAN'T GET IN TOUCH WITH ANYONE</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: THEY MUST BE DROPPING LIKE BEHEMOTH LEAVINGS OUT THERE.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">PCG: GAMZEE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO GO CRAZY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: I THINK IF HE DOES</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: IT MEANS WE FUCKED SOMETHING UP.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: IT MEANS *I* FUCKED SOMETHING UP.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">PCG: AND I DIDN'T DO THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: ONE TIME, ONE OF THE DOOMED ARADIAS TOLD ME SHE CAME FROM A TIME WHERE HE FLIPPED OUT AND KILLED EVERYBODY, BECAUSE OF MY FAILURE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: I DIDN'T TAKE HER SERIOUSLY, BUT I SHOULD HAVE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: SHE WAS CONSTANTLY FIXING MY FUCKUPS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: ROBOTS FROM THE FUTURE ALWAYS COMING BACK TO TELL ME HOW SOME HASTY SHIT I DID WITH FROG BREEDING OR WHATEVER WOULD MAKE IT BE IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: MY OWN PERSONAL MISTAKES PROBABLY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE DOOMED ARADIABOTS THAN ANYTHING ELSE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: WHICH WAS SORT OF A SILVER LINING I GUESS? I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE BEATEN THE KING WITHOUT HER ARMY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: NOT THAT IT MATTERS ANYMORE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: I'VE OBVIOUSLY BECOME JUST ANOTHER GUY IN A DOOMED TIMELINE WATCHING EVERYONE AROUND HIM DIE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: I WAS JUST SITTING HERE WONDERING WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE WRONG THIS TIME</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: TO MAKE THE TIMELINE TAKE A WRONG TURN</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: AND PINPOINTING IT SEEMED OVERWHELMING SINCE I'VE MADE MORE TERRIBLE DECISIONS THAN I CAN EVEN COUNT.</span>
