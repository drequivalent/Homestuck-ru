<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: oh looks like you got caledfwlch</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: you found that pretty fast</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: is that how you pronounce that</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: yeah i guess so</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i think its welsh</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what are welsh things doing in this game</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: thats an awesome question</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: fuck yeah it is</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: is this thing as pointless as i think it is or do i need it for something</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: tactically yeah its a downgrade since its what i used to make caledscratch which is obviously way better</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: yeah thats what i figured</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: caledscratch cycles the sword through its own timeline to points when its broken or nonbroken or old and rusted or recently forged etc</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and your snoop snowcone swords probably even better than that so yeah you got options</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: fuck it ill just power through the rest of the game with the SORD.....</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: hahahaha</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: with unreal air as a mount fit for a true artifact knight</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: to do something important with it though not really sure what</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: hes a pretty ornery dude</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: kept raving about how he was waiting for the forge to come</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: which he needs to complete his work</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but in my timeline the forge would never come</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: so he was extra pissed off</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: its important to getting your shit figured out</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: you were supposed to break it to get it out of the thing</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: like another personal sort of mythological milestone you were supposed to clear</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: really</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: all tangled up in ridiculous riddles and bullshit enigmas</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and maybe its all a moot point anyway in this timeline who knows</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but i think ill spare you all that crap</span>
