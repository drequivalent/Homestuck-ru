<span style="color: #626262">CCG: YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY AMAZING HOW BEHIND THE TIMES YOU ARE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU'VE SLEPT THROUGH THIS WHOLE ADVENTURE</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: OH WAIT, THAT IS ESSENTIALLY TRUE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: IT WAS HILARIOUS WATCHING YOU GROW UP.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD ALL THE ANSWERS, FROLICKING ALL OVER YOUR ISLAND BEING INFURIATINGLY CHIPPER, BUILDING ROBO-BUNNIES LIKE A MORON AND ULTIMATELY RUINING EVERYTHING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: YOU WERE SO SURE YOUR DREAMS TOLD YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEEDED TO KNOW.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: AND NOW LOOK AT YOU</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: YOU SUDDENLY UNDERSTAND JACK SHIT.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">?GG: ok i understand that you are another group of players and you are in some sort of trouble</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">?GG: but maybe if you had been nice to me instead of terrorizing me all those years i would have believed you</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">?GG: and we could have worked together to solve your problems as well as ours</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">?GG: it just makes me sad to think thats probably impossible now because you are so angry and stubborn!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: DON'T TELL ME WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE I'M ANGRY AND STUBBORN.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: I FUCKING KNOW WHAT THOSE ASSETS MAKE POSSIBLE.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">CCG: TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF GETTING TO BE STUDIED AND MOCKED BY ME FOR YOUR WHOLE PATHETIC MISERABLE LIFE?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: DO YOU REALIZE I'M YOUR GOD? YES, YOUR LITERAL GOD, THAT'S RIGHT.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND NOW ALL THIS FROTHING PANDEMONIUM JUMPING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS JUST RIDICULOUS OVERCOMPENSATION FOR YOUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS AND MISTAKES, AND MASKING SOME FEELINGS YOU'RE NOT REALLY IN TOUCH WITH.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THIS IS ALL SO OBVIOUS, I'M FLUSHING LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER IN EMBARRASSMENT HAVING TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU, AND EVEN WORSE, REMEMBERING HAVING IT EXPLAINED TO ME BY THE SMART ONE THREE HOURS AGO AND STILL ACTING LIKE A MOIST GLOBE EVEN AFTER BEING SO SOUNDLY SCHOOLFED.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I JUST SLAPPED MYSELF! I REMEMBERED MY LAME NOTE TO MYSELF FROM THREE HOURS AGO, AND THEN SLAPPED MYSELF SPECIFICALLY TO MOCK YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT STINGS TOO, YOU'LL FEEL IT IN A WHILE. AND THEN THE GHOST OF PAST ME WILL CRY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: PAST ME DOESN'T EVEN EXIST ANYMORE. HE'S A STUPID BAWLING WIGGLER PHANTOM. HE'S DEAD, NOT A REAL GUY ANYMORE, LIKE ME.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I'M THE REAL ONE. YOU'RE FAKE, A SHADOW OF A SAD MEMORY THAT PISSED ITS PANTS WHILE SCREAMING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: TIME TO DEAL WITH IT.</span>
