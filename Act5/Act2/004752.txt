<span style="color: #4ac925">?GG: but maybe if you had been nice to me instead of terrorizing me all those years i would have believed you</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">?GG: and we could have worked together to solve your problems as well as ours</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">?GG: it just makes me sad to think thats probably impossible now because you are so angry and stubborn!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: DON'T TELL ME WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE I'M ANGRY AND STUBBORN.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THIS IS ALL SO OBVIOUS, I'M FLUSHING LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER IN EMBARRASSMENT HAVING TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU, AND EVEN WORSE, REMEMBERING HAVING IT EXPLAINED TO ME BY THE SMART ONE THREE HOURS AGO AND STILL ACTING LIKE A MOIST GLOBE EVEN AFTER BEING SO SOUNDLY SCHOOLFED.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT STINGS TOO, YOU'LL FEEL IT IN A WHILE. AND THEN THE GHOST OF PAST ME WILL CRY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: PAST ME DOESN'T EVEN EXIST ANYMORE. HE'S A STUPID BAWLING WIGGLER PHANTOM. HE'S DEAD, NOT A REAL GUY ANYMORE, LIKE ME.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I'M THE REAL ONE. YOU'RE FAKE, A SHADOW OF A SAD MEMORY THAT PISSED ITS PANTS WHILE SCREAMING.</span>
