carcinoGeneticist <span style="color: #626262">[CG]</span> began trolling gardenGnostic <span style="color: #4ac925">[GG]</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: pw.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SERIOUSLY, WHY DID YOU GO BACK TO SEE HER? YOU DIDN'T MENTION THIS LAST TIME.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: listen fuckass</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i am going to need a password before we continue</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: plz &lt;3</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: RIGHT, OK.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: LET'S SEE IF I CAN REMEMBER, IT WAS PRETTY ELABORATE IF I RECALL, OK HERE GOES.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I'M A DISGUSTING WORTHLESS BILGESACK ON THE GARGANTUAN TEAT OF A LABORING, LEPROUS MUSCLEBEAST. MY SELF ESTEEM IS SO SMALL, ITS EXISTENCE IS A MATTER OF CONJECTURE AMONG THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS. I SMELL SO BAD, THE STENCH CANNOT BE EXPRESSED WITH EVEN THE MOST ELOQUENT, FLORID LANGUAGE. THE ODOR MY BODY MAKES HAS MADE POETS CRY. I HAVE WON SPECIAL AWARDS FOR DISCOVERING NEW PLACES TO TOUCH MYSELF EROTICALLY WHILE FARTING. I UNFAIRLY PULVERIZE THE COMPETITION IN ASSHOLE PAGEANTS, AND I HAVE RECEIVED A LIFETIME BAN FROM UGLY CONTESTS BY PRESIDENT SHITFACE HIMSELF. MY BLOOD IS NOT FIT TO FLOW THROUGH A SEWER, AND MY SIGN IS A PICTOGRAPHIC SYMBOL THAT LOOSELY TRANSLATES AS &quot;PLEASE HIKE THESE PANTS UP TO THIS GUY'S ARMPITS, CHAIN HIM TO A FLOGGING JUT, AND MAKE A FUCKING EXAMPLE OUT OF THIS SORRY SACK OF SHIT.&quot; WHEN I LOOK IN A MIRROR, MY REFLECTION SLOWLY SHAKES HIS HEAD WHILE I WET MYSELF IN SHAME.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ....................... :|</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT, THAT WAS IT, WASN'T IT. HOW WAS THAT NOT FUCKING IT, DID I FORGET AN APOSTROPHE SOMEWHERE?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: no karkat, that was not quite the password</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but you were on the right track :p</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: CAN WE JUST TALK NOW</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: do you even remember the right password?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF GRATUITOUS SELF DEPRECATION FORCED INTO MY MOUTH, INVOLVING REFERENCE TO SOME KIND OF WEIRD HUMAN COUPLING RITUAL?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: youre being deliberately dumb</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it was...</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: IF I HATE MYSELF SO MUCH, THEN WHY DON'T I HATEMARRY MYSELF?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: remember?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i was just using the password system to poke a little fun at you, and you turn it into this whole overdramatic thing, jeeeeez.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HAHA! WHEE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: CAN WE GET DOWN TO FUCKING BUSINESS AGAIN?</span>
