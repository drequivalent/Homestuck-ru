Welcome to my apartment. I trust you'll find my voice is more palatable against this decor. I continue to be an excellent host.

I'm expecting two more guests later. First one, and then another. 

Make yourself comfortable in the meantime. But don't touch the candy on the table. That is reserved for one of my guests.
