<span style="color: #626262">PCG: BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S LIKE A NORMAL DISEASE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: NOT LIKE A CELLULAR MUTATION THAT'S OUT OF CONTROL</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: THE CANCER TOOK A SPECIFIC FORM, LIKE A COMPLICATED SERIES OF TERRIBLE EVENTS RATHER THAN FAULTY CELL DIVISION</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: IT WAS AN EVENTUALITY IN YOUR UNIVERSE THAT WAS INEVITABLE, THAT WE ALL UNWITTINGLY HELPED MAKE HAPPEN</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: ALL CONCENTRATED THROUGH THE ACTIONS OF ONE HOSTILE AGENT IN THE SYSTEM, WITH AN INSTINCT TO DESTROY EVERYTHING IT HATED</span>
<span style="color: #626262">PCG: AND THEN GIVEN THE POWER TO DO SO.</span>
