<span style="color: #005682">AG: It was ok.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I admit it was a little 8etter than I expected.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yessssssss, i knew it!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut who cares! Let's not get sidetracked 8y films a8out wounded, muscular renegades.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8y the way, John, have you ever considered growing your hair out?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I 8et it would look fa8ulous.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no, it would look so stupid!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I don't know a8out that!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I have an eye for fashion. 8 of them, in fact!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i thought you didn't want to get sidetracked!!!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Oh yeah. Whoops. ::::\</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: anyway, putting me to sleep and landing me in hot water is one thing...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but you sort of indirectly caused a MUCH BIGGER problem!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: before i fell asleep, i was about to prototype something really ridiculous to make jack weaker.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i am pretty sure that it would have made jack lose both eyes, both arms, and give him silly blue hair, and possibly also make him be a girl?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: he probably would have been pretty easy to beat!!!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but instead, it was prototyped by jade's first guardian dog lusus.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and now he is unstoppable!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and he becomes the one who is stirrin' up all that trouble in your session too!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i mean, it sounds like your intentions were good, but you probably didn't realize to what extent you were messing everything up!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Don't 8e a8surd, John.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Of course I realized that would happen.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It was pretty much the whole point, you goof!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what????????</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: vriska, why would you do that!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Jegus, calm down.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why should i calm down when you just said you deliberately sabotaged all of us?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Relaaaaaaaax.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Listen, John.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Regardless of what I did, he is already here.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I know this consequence will 8e hard for you to accept, 8ut whenever you feel angry or confused a8out it, just repeat this to yourself.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It should 8ecome your mantra!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: He is already here.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Say it, John!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but what does that mean!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It means what it sounds like! He's already here!!!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Here in our session, trying to hunt us down! Man, this should 8e elementary to you 8y now.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: No matter what you or I or any of us did, Jack's here now. That's the reality!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And if I didn't stop you, it wouldn't have changed the reality for us here. We'd still 8e hiding on this rock, and he'd still 8e out there, sniffing around for us.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: He wouldn't just disappear! That's not how this time stuff works.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: All that REALLY would have happened is I would have allowed you to do something you weren't supposed to do!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You would have prototyped with your pretty 8lue doll, 8ecause of course deep down you know you are o8sessed with me.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And then you and all your friends would exist in a splintered timeline. And you wouldn't even 8e a8le to talk to me anymore! ::::(</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And then you'd 8e doooooooomed.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I mean, more doomed than you are already. :::;)</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Trust me, I am really smart. I have this all figured out.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i don't know if that makes sense!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i mean, it kind of does...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but something doesn't really add up about it.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: if you knew he was going to be created regardless of what anyone did...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why did you decide to involve yourself that way?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: like the way you are involving yourself with me becoming a hero or whatever?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You just answered your own question!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I did it 8ecause I wanted to 8e the one responsi8le for cre8ting him.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: augh!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: BUT WHYYYYYYYY!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ecause, John.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It only makes sense that I would be the one to cre8te him.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Since I am also going to 8e the one to kill him.</span>
