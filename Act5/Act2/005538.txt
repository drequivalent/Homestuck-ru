<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: rose please say something</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you are making me nervous...</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I should have gone looking for her.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why didn't I?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: umm</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: because you were busy trying to make the best of this situation?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: John was too. But he went to look for his father.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It would have been normal of me. I can't remember what I was trying to prove anymore.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i dont think you should be so hard on yourself about it</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: john was being john, and you were being you, which i guess meant taking our problems very seriously and putting all your attention on solving them!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: and anyway, you and your mom had a much trickier relationship than john and his dad didnt you?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i mean, not that i am saying that means you were any less attached to her than him...</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: argh, i dont know if im very good at consoling people. sorry rose i dont want to make you feel worse :(</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You're doing fine.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: For someone raised by a dog.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Or really,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Anyone.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Thanks.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: whew, ok</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you know...</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: now we have all lost guardians</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: dave lost his, and i lost mine in a weird way... uuum even though that was pretty much definitely my fault :\</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: and even the trolls all lost their monster guardians</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i think that maybe it is an inevitable part of a game that can be cruel sometimes</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: For some reason, despite all the danger, I never thought she was in any trouble.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I never believed she would actually die.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I grew up with the feeling that something more significant had always been meant for her.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That she was a heroine displaced in some way, resigned to the inglorious duty of raising me, and preparing me in her way.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I didn't actually need the ectobiological verification that she was like a mother and a sister at the same time. I always understood that somehow.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And I felt she had knowledge and ability beyond what she let on. It was always intimidating, but nonetheless a source of respect which was childishly begrudging on my part.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think she was just waiting for me to catch up with her.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But now I can't.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ......</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i am so sad</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: rose i think you are being stronger about it than i am</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Probably because my emotions have now ceded to anger.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This shouldn't have happened.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i just hope you arent thinking of doing something rash</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I already was.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I was going to go to sleep, fly to a sun bigger than our universe, drop a bomb in it, and kill myself.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeaaah...</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So if my course of action is to change on account of my mood, it can only become less impetuous, don't you think?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: errrr, i dont know?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You never liked my plan very much anyway.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: wellllll</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: no!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but i was trusting that you had thought it through and it was our best hope</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm not sure if I did.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe it was a terrible plan.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I made it without a full understanding of the nature of the Scratch.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: hm</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: then what will you do?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I could stop being so cowardly, for once.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I could short circuit this endlessly expanding game of chess we're playing, just like Jack decided to do.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: what does that mean!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe I will go kill Jack myself.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Right now.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh no no no no no!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: rose that is a much much worse plan!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: he would probably kill you!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Probably.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But the Scratch will wipe us out anyway, and reboot the conditions of our session.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I suddenly don't feel much like sneaking through the back door of the Furthest Ring for retribution by distant super nova.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i know what you mean, i was angry at jack and wanted to stop him too, but we have to think of a more sensible way to do it</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Whether my existing plan was sensible or not,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I may have been allowing myself to be manipulated by an omniscient being regardless.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: what? who?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Hello ladies.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: aaaaaaa whaaaaat?????</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This is a private conversation.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Private even to those who know it word for word already.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Proceed.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">I will be here.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Watching.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: rose who is this!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ignore him.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i dont even know whats going on anymore</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">You were discussing Ms. Lalonde's intrepid new variation on suicide.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">As one with a passion for the subject, I'm intrigued.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Shh.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Anyway, if it's true the gods have &quot;selected&quot; me for service, maybe the power they've given me will be sufficient.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe they wanted me to kill him all along.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Hee hee.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: SHHHHHHHHHH!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: please dont rose, i know you are angry but you arent thinking straight</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But I am.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm fully aware I'll probably die and fail. Scratch happens, we start fresh. No recollection, no problem.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: nooo :(</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Jade, as an ambassador of Skaia, maybe you'd be willing to talk some sense into your friend?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">You should understand she's been corrupted by various entities with some rather questionable motives.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: rose, maybe white text guy is right?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: the dark gods gave you all these powers, and seem to be helping us with dream bubbles and stuff...</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but what if they are not actually good?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: They are enormous, ugly, and live in darkness.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That doesn't necessarily make them bad.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: no...</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but i still dont trust them!</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">If only there were a way to make this determination with certainty.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Through a reliable source within reach, for instance, at this exact moment. Perhaps one that is spherical, and devastatingly handsome.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: whats this weirdo talking about!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The cue ball.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh yeah</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i noticed you found it!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i was worried it had been destroyed when my room blew up</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: is he saying you can use it?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes. And he is right.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: omg</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: does it work???</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It advised me to talk to you just now.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So I guess so.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: then maybe you should try it!</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes, Rose. Listen to Jade.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">She is far less manipulative than I.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What are you suggesting I ask it?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: since we dont know much about the gods...</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: why dont you ask it about them?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So, you're saying I should ask it if the gods are evil?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i guess that is a way to put it</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Even though at this point neither of you is highlighting my text to read it, this idea gets my vote.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Go ahead.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Ask, Seer.</span>
