<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it brought me inside the palace.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it was huge, and it took a long time to explore. it was eerily empty too.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i had that weird feeling of getting to a place in a video game you are not supposed to be yet, because you don't have the right powerups and such.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: you know what i mean?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Not really.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I'm used to taking shortcuts whenever I play games.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, ok.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so, i started getting crazy nervous the longer i was down here, and i was starting to wonder if my silly iron pogo hammer would even do any damage against the monster.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: *Snort.*</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Against a denizen? Of course that piece of shit isn't going to do anything.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: If I were you, I would have chucked it into the forge.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: excuse me, it is called the wrinkle fucker, and it is totally amazing.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It might 8e alright if you com8ined it with something awesome.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Like some cool dice, for instance.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that's so absurd, like anything like that would ever even happen!!!</span>
