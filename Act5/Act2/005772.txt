<span style="color: #626262">CG: ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IF WE CAN RIDE THIS OUT FOR A LITTLE LONGER UNTIL THE CRITICAL MOMENT, AND DAVE/ROSE CAN DESTROY THE SUN, JACK SHOULDN'T BE A THREAT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: CONVENIENTLY, IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL, THAT WILL SIGNAL THE BEGINNING OF OUR OWN ESCAPE PLAN.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what is your plan?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: APPARENTLY THE EXPLOSION WILL BE SO HUGE, IT WILL BE VISIBLE AT GREAT DISTANCES THROUGHOUT THE FURTHEST RING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: EVEN FROM DIFFERENT SESSIONS, LIKE YOURS AND OURS. YOU WON'T GET TO SEE IT BECAUSE BY THEN YOUR SESSION SHOULD BE WIPED OUT BY THE SCRATCH.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT WE WILL. THE PLAN IS TO USE IT AS A BEACON, AND TRAVEL THERE AS A RENDEZVOUS POINT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: rendezvous with who?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THERE. THAT'S WHAT JADE TELLS ME.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: jade knows so many things lately, what is even her deal?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HELL IF I KNOW, THIS IS BASICALLY DREAM INTELLIGENCE, EVERY TIME SHE GOES TO SLEEP, SHE HAS MORE TO RAMBLE ABOUT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SHE SAYS I SHOULD GO TO SLEEP TO FIND OUT, BUT I'M LIKE HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO BE NAPPING BETWEEN MAKING ALL THESE PLANS AND GETTING PERSECUTED BY THIS DEMENTED HONKING ASSHOLE?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SO YEAH, WE'LL MEET IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE EXPLOSION WITH OUR PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE, OR I GUESS I SHOULD SAY OUTSIDE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I DON'T THINK THEY CAN COME WITH US THOUGH.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: come with you where? who are they?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: DEAD PEOPLE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AS FOR WHERE, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO STICK AROUND THERE FOREVER. THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE DEPRESSING, SINCE WE'RE NOT FUCKING GHOSTS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THE SCRATCH WILL REBOOT YOUR SESSION. YOUR WHOLE UNIVERSE ACTUALLY. SO SOMEWHERE IN THIS DREADFUL ABYSS, THAT NEW SESSION WILL START UP IN ITS OWN INCIPISPHERE, FROM SCRATCH.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: LOOK AT THAT, ANOTHER PUN BECAUSE OF USING THAT FUCKING WORD EVERY OTHER SENTENCE! KILL ME NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT THAT &quot;FROM SCRATCH&quot; (F'ING LOL!) SESSION IS WHAT YOU'RE SHOOTING FOR TO SURVIVE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THE IDEA IS FOR YOU ALL TO PRESERVE YOURSELVES BY ESCAPING THERE.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: through the lawn ring?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YES.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: ONCE YOU'RE THERE, YOU WILL HELP US FIND OUR WAY THERE TOO, AND THEN WE CAN ALL FINALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUCK TO DO WITH THE REST OF OUR LIVES.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh!!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so then, this is how we're supposed to meet. that is kind of exciting.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH, I GUESS, IF ENOUGH OF US ARE ALIVE BY THEN TO MEET.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so, i guess you are not worried about it turning into a huge sloppy makeout fest anymore...</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: UH</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: RIGHT! HAHAHA, JOHN, YOU AND VRISKA BETTER KEEP YOUR HANDS TO YOURSELVES, OR EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE. NO INTERSPECIES FUNNYBUSINESS, IS THAT CLEAR!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BLAAAAAAARGH, I AM CONVINCINGLY FLIPPING MY LID ABOUT THIS, WAVING MY ARMS AROUND A LOT, AND MAKING ALL MY BEST YELLING FACES. WOW, LOOK AT THAT! IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT AGAIN.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: huh?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: POOF! SUBJECT CHANGED.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IF IT WORKS AND YOU WIND UP IN THE NEW SESSION, THAT'S WHY IT'LL BE IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE ONE OF THE DERSE DREAMERS STAYS WITH YOU, SO THEY CAN HELP GUIDE US THERE FROM THE RING.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: won't there be other players in the new session?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: like, alternate universe versions of ourselves or such?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: PROBABLY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT THOSE CHUMPS WON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT US, OR ALL OUR PLANS. WHY WOULD THEY?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah... it's just kind of a weird thought.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SO OUT OF EVERYTHING WE JUST TALKED ABOUT, THIS IS THE THING THAT HAS YOU TRIPPING GLOBES? WHATEVER YOU SAY!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but i guess it's sort of comforting too.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: if rose or dave have to go off and die, at least i get to see them again, in a way.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: even if i will only be alternate universe john to them.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: maybe my dad will be alive in that session too!!!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OK, MAYBE, BUT BEFORE YOU GET TOO EXCITED ABOUT THAT, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THERE FIRST.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAY, AND STICK TO THE PLAN.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON GETTING READY TO START THE SCRATCH. THE GAME DOESN'T MAKE A HARD RESET THAT EASY TO PULL OFF.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: ONCE YOU INITIATE IT, THE GAME THROWS EVERYTHING IT'S GOT AT YOU. WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY YOU'RE THE BEST GUY FOR THE JOB, BECAUSE OF YOUR SUPERPOWERS AND SILLY WINDY BULLSHIT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok. i'll do my best.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what should i do right now?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: GET PREPARED, MAKE ALL THE EQUIPMENT YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED, STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WAIT FOR JADE TO SEND THAT CODE, WAIT FOR ME TO CONTACT YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND DO YOUR BEST TO HUMOR HIM WHILE HE IGNORANTLY ATTEMPTS TO FLAME YOU BACK INTO THE PUDDLE OF SLIME YOU CRAWLED OUT OF.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: PLEASE.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, man.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: our &quot;first&quot; conversation ever? i can't wait.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH, BUT CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING IN MY DEFENSE BEFORE THAT HAPPENS?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I DON'T ACTUALLY HATE YOU, AND I NEVER DID. I WAS DELUDING MYSELF.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: DEEP DOWN I'M SURE I WAS ALWAYS PRETTY OK WITH YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: thanks karkat!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT WASN'T A FUCKING COMPLIMENT.</span>
