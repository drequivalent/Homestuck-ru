<span style="color: #005682">AG: John, why are you standing around wasting time????????</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: um, i don't know. you can see my future, can't you?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: how much time am i wasting?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Enough to make me wonder what the hell your deal is!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: then i would venture to guess i am wasting time because you chose to pester me just now!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Dammit, John.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Stop sounding smarter than me. It is un8ecoming of someone so inferior.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i mean, i was just pausing for a moment...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: to look at my trashed movie posters.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: they bring back memories, of a life that i guess is long gone now.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but you probably know what that is all about.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah, I know.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it wasn't even that long ago, but it already seems like forever since i was on earth!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it was a pretty nice place, i bet you would have liked it.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It seems a little too sunny for my liking.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, what about you? do you miss your planet, and your parents and such?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: The life I left 8ehind wasn't so hot, to 8e honest.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh. that's too bad.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Why don't we not talk a8out that!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: What are these movies, anyway? They look just awful.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but you see, that is where you are wrong. these films are the finest earth has to offer!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Are they a8out clowns?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no, no. i drew those clowns in my sleep, for some reason.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: ::::|</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: this one here is so great. it is about this street tough renegade who did hard time behind bars, and wants nothing more in the world than to reunite with his loving wife and daughter. but not so fast! he has to go on crazy and dangerous escapades through the sky with a motley assortment of rogues led by john malkovich, who is wise to cage's heroic nature and pure heart. they tether a grumpy police man's awesome car to the plane and smash it, and then later they crash into some casinos. cage gets out of the wreckage and hugs his family, and i usually tear up a little.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that is my working troll title for the movie, i hope it was ok.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: John, even though your title is quite amusing and pro8a8ly kind of cute, that movie sounds hilariously 8ad!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, well you are hilariously WRONG!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: here, hang on, i will show you.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/hullohumminburr" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://tinyurl.com/hullohumminburr</a></span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, but you will probably have to use your troll thingy to rewind time or whatever, to before the earth internet blew up so you can watch it.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Is this like the Earth equivalent of Gru8tu8e or something?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i guess??</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Man. I am not watching this shitty video. It looks so 8ad!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, suit yourself.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but there it is, in case you are ever hankering after some incredible movie magic.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Ok, I will 8e sure 8ookmark it and la8el it &quot;dum8 kid's retarded nonsense.&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, good idea.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8y the way! Why aren't you using your computer glasses to talk suddenly????????</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: This device seems less efficient, and doesn't look as cool!</span>
