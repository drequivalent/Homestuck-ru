<span style="color: #008141">GA: Any Reason At All Really</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: To Justify Wasting The Few Precious Remaining Moments Of My Life On You</span>

<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Was Just Leaving</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: so you're a time traveler?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: No</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: We Dont Actually Travel Through</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Uh</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Well</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Not All Of Us Do</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: One Of Us Does Though</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Thats Not What We Are Talking About Here And Is Aside From The Point</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: so let me see if i have this straight...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: you are a time traveling space alien from the future, sent here to study humans?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: No</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: are you from mars? is it a mission of peace?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: No John You Werent Listening</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: what does your time machine look like? a phone booth? phone booths are a popular thing for some reason.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Damn It</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: were you lured to earth by a huge gyroscopey thing that jodie foster piloted in contact, while matthew mcconaughey sort of acted as her spiritual guide i guess...</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: What The Hell</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: and then he kind of preached to her about having faith instead of believing in the sciences so hard all the time, and i guess in the end she believed him, maybe?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: actually, im not even sure what the point of mcconaughey was in that movie. but he was still awesome.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: and then jodie found her dad on an alien planet... but i think he was a ghost or something? or maybe an alien in disguise.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: and then she went home and nobody believed her, but you just KNOW mcconaughey believed her.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: because he had all the faith. and i mean ALL OF IT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: anyway, does that have any applicability to your cosmic interstellar astrojourney?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Okay Youre Even Dumber Than The Rose Human Thats Incredible Really</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: pff, i know i'm dumber than rose, that is not much of a burn, dude!</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Im A Girl Not A Boy</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: oh, sorry.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i don't know why i thought you were.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Happens</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: were you trolling rose too?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: TIME TRAVEL TROLLING???</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes As A Matter Of Fact</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: oh boy, let me go put on my quantum space hat, and extra terrestrial adventure boots, and you can tell me all about it.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: If You Werent So Stupid Id Suspect You Were Being Insincere For The Benefit Of Your Amusement</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: ha ha ha. i don't follow!</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Just Spoke To Her In The Future</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Shes An Imbecile And Conveying How Much I Dislike Her At This Point Presents An Overwhelming Gauntlet Of Personal Expression</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But Regardless She Said To Paste Something From Our Conversation</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: To Get You To Understand Whats Going On</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Have Strong Doubts It Will Be Effective But Here Goes</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: GA: I Should Figure Out How The Viewport Feature Of This Application Works</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: GA: So I Can See What Such A Primitive Creature Looks Like</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: TT: haha, well i know what you guys look like.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: TT: you look kind of like... </span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: TT: howie mandel from little monsters. </span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: TT: even though, to be perfectly frank, he was kind of a big monster. </span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: TT: because he was a big goofy adult. </span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: TT: and fred savage was like his child prankster sidekick.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: GA: Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest </span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: TT: no, it's a movie. </span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: TT: you should ask john about it, because he thinks it's awesome, which it is. </span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: hahaha! oh man, you blew it!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: now i know for sure you're trolling me. rose hates that movie.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Are You Suggesting</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Was Being Trolled</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: That It Was A Charade Meant To Make Me Look Foolish</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: possibly! i know that sure didn't sound like her.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: but i think it's more likely that you made it all up cause you know i like that movie.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: so i tip my cap to you, well played miss troll!</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Now Im Wondering If You Might Be Trolling Me As Well</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: ok well, just between you and me...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: SOMEONE here is getting trolled.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: and it just might be all three of us.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Okay</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: but you shoulda told me you liked little monsters!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: we could jam about that. what was your favorite part?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Suspicions Pitching Once Again Toward The Conclusion That You Are Just Very Stupid</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i really want to get a little monsters poster, but they're hard to find!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i asked my dad for one for christmas. fingers crossed!</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Im Guessing Thats The Human Equivalent Of 12th Perigees Eve</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Will Your Adult Human Custodian Forage For Leavings As Ours Do</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: yup, that sure keeps sounding alien of you.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: keep up the good work!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: listen, i'm kind of busy, i have to wrap this present and mail it in a hurry.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: so i'm going to block you!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: but i might unblock you again soon, because you're kinda cool.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Your Blocks Mean Nothing But Dont Worry You Wont Hear From Me Again</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: yeah well...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: you might just hear from me!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: also, you should give rose another chance.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: she is really great! whatever she did, she was probably just pulling her mind games on you, it's all in fun.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: there is more to her than that, you'll see.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: bye!</span>
