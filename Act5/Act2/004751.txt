<span style="color: #626262">CG: HOLY SHIT, IT'S HARLEY</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: COMMUNICATING WITH ME OUT OF NOWHERE OF HER OWN VOLITION</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HOLD THAT THOUGHT WHILE I GO INFORM MY DISGRACE OF A CLOWN FRIEND ABOUT THIS TRUE REAL LIFE MIRACLE, IT MIGHT LIFT HIS SPIRITS</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I HAVE TO SPREAD THE WICKED WORD LIKE I'M MASSAGING SHITTY SPARKLEDUST AROUND MY NETHER REGIONS TO ASSUAGE A VICIOUS RASH</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT'S LIKE I'M SEASONING A FUCKING STEAK HERE.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i knew i would regret this</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: talking to you is so terrible</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: its making my headache worse</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OH YEAH, BECAUSE TALKING TO YOU HAS JUST BEEN ABSOLUTE EUPHORIA.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME ABOUT HEADACHES.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LUMBERJACK SPLITTING WOOD ON MY THINK PAN.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HE'S GOT THE FOREARMS OF A CHOLERBEAR, A MOUNTAIN OF LOGS, AND NOTHING BUT FUCKING TIME.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: uuuugh shut uuuuup!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: will you just tell me what you wanted?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO CONTACT ME, NOT THAT I'M NOT TICKLED BY THE SURPRISE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: LET'S CATCH UP. HOW IS EVERYTHING? HOW WAS YOUR DEATHNAP?? I CAN ONLY HOPE IT WAS AS REFRESHING AS MINE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT'S THAT? HOW AM I? I'M GREAT, FEEL LIKE A MILLION BOONBANKS EVER SINCE MY LITTLE POWER SNOOZE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: STILL PRETTY TIRED THOUGH. YOU LOOK A LITTLE DROWSY YOURSELF. BUT WE WON'T BE GOING BACK TO SLEEP ANY TIME SOON, WILL WE JADE?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: NO WAY. A PAIR OF FEISTY GOGETTERS LIKE YOU AND ME, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR DREAMS OF HORRORTERRORS FONDLING EVERY RECESS OF OUR NAKED PSYCHES, PLEASANT THOUGH THEY ARE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT USELESS SCAMPERING AND GIGGLING TO DO. WHEREAS I HAVE A CRUCIAL DATE WITH A PNEUMATIC DRILL, TO BORE A HOLE IN THE CENTER OF MY FOREHEAD, DEEP INTO THE PLUMP ANGUISH BLADDER WHICH STORES MY ALIEN DISMAY FLUID. THAT'S A REAL THING WE HAVE, FYI.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I WILL THEN PERFORM A LITTLE SOFT SHOE NUMBER IN THE PUDDLE OF FLUID THAT ACCUMULATES ON THE FLOOR, WHILE MAKING THE BIGGEST SMILE EVER ATTEMPTED BY SOMEONE NOT CLINICALLY RETARDED.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I WILL DO THIS FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT, JADE. TO SAY THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i cant believe i fell for this</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it was just a setup to troll me some more</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: why do you go to such lengths to troll me? i just dont understand it</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: TRY TO BE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: TROLLING IS AN ACTIVITY THAT SHARES A NAME WITH MY ENTIRE SPECIES</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: DO I GET ON YOUR CASE FOR ALL THE TERRIBLE HUMANNING YOU DO?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: thats ridiculous, humanning isnt a word</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: and if it was, it would be a nicer thing to do than trolling!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you know what i mean, stop pretending you dont</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: TELL ME JADE</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHY ARE YOU SUCH A RACIST?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: aaaaaaa that is something a troll would say!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YES, EXACTLY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I AM A TROLL. IT SEEMS WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i mean you are being patronizing and disingenuous to get a rise out of me</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: and that is really really shitty!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i am so tired of it, and i am done talking to you forever</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: bye karkat, it was awful knowing you!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WAIT</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OK LOOK</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I SERIOUSLY, HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU SAY YOUR ROBOT BLEW UP, AND THAT WAS SOME SORT OF SIGNAL TO MESSAGE ME?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: as if my day needed another reason to get worse</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T CONTACT THE RIGHT ME.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: what does that mean!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I MEAN FUTURE ME IS PROBABLY THE ONE TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SINCE IT'S ALL NEWS TO ME.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: is this another prank</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you are seriously the worst at pranks</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I DON'T PLAY PRANKS, THAT'S JUVENILE NONSENSE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I DO TWO THINGS AND TWO THINGS ONLY, I DEVASTATE SORRY MOTHERFUCKERS, AND GET SHIT DONE AS AN AWESOME LEADER.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IN THIS CASE, I AM ACCOMPLISHING THE LATTER.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HERE, CLICK THIS AND WE WILL SOLVE THE MYSTERY TOGETHER.</span>
