<span style="color: #005682">AG: It was 8efore I ever started gaming, or rounding up other kids to feed my lusus.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I was nearing the age where I would 8e expected to feed her.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And she was starting to get so 8ig, that she would have to crawl out of the caverns soon, no longer a8le to feast on stray wigglers she caught in her we8.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It was kind of an intense sym8iotic thing, a particularly demanding lusus-troll relationship, and only really strong kids are supposed to 8e a8le to handle it.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So of course I was terrified of the responsi8ility looming!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I really didn't think I would make it. I was sure I'd fail, and my lusus would either get angry and eat me, or she'd just die and then I'd 8e culled.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut then I saw a shooting star one evening.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I tracked down where it landed, and found a chest with my sign on it.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: A sign is an insignia we must wear, specific to our class. Each class has a huge alpha8et of signs, so when someone shares yours, you know you have a lot in common. I was so excited to see it.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what was in the chest!</span>
