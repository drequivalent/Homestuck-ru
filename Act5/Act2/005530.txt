<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then can you at least tell me if we will be successful in preserving ourselves after the reset?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">I don't particularly enjoy spoiling things for people when unnecessary.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">I find speaking in a discreet color helps avoid this.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So if the Scratch isn't specifically meant to banish Jack from the session,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And our quest to destroy the sun is meant to kill him,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why is the reset necessary at all, especially if it means oblivion for us?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Because you cannot achieve the ultimate reward in this session.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Your battlefield is cancerous, and the reckoning will destroy it prematurely regardless.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">By resetting, you will create a session which can bear the fruit of a new universe, even if you will not be the ones to claim the reward.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Don't you want to fulfill your purpose?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But it's a little disheartening to learn I'm now faced with not one, but two suicide missions at once.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: One to destroy Jack's power source and defend all of existence, and another to ensure our cosmic progeny at the price of oblivion.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">That frames the dual objectives accurately.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">But if you are inventive, you may find a way to survive the reset and participate in the renewed session.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">It's up to you.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Just as it's up to you to face the decision to claim immortality before you enter your creation.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Immortality?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Do you mean ascending to the god tier?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I have reason to believe that I won't.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The trolls have not indicated I will die on my Quest Bed, or that any of us will aside from John. Instead I've been given a more troubling and ambiguous forecast.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">What have I said about confirming the reliability of your sources?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you saying I will?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">No.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Well, will I?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">It seems you'd like me to do some more fortune telling.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Fine.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe this question will suit you better.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is it probable?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">That's a strange question to ask someone who is omniscient and therefore knows outcomes with one hundred percent certainty.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">I like it.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then what's your answer?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">You have exactly a fifty percent chance of ascending to the god tier.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's a strange answer.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">I know.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why such a precise probability?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Because, much like the decisions you must face to complete your dual suicide missions, you have two ways of achieving godhood to choose from.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Two ways?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: By dying on the Quest Bed on my planet, and some other way?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is there another Quest Bed somewhere?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes. Good guess, Seer.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Where?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">What difference does it make? You already know where the first one is. You have the choice to go there right now and take your own life.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's true.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Of course it is.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You mentioned immortality.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Godhood makes one immortal?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: A god tier will live forever, with no caveats?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">No.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">One will live forever, unless killed.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">The death must be either heroic or just.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: How are those terms defined?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Broadly, mysteriously, and according to the case of the individual.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">One may be killed by opposing a corrupt adversary and die for a just cause, as through martyrdom, for instance. This would be heroic.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Or one may be subject to corruption, and slain by a hero. This would be just.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Which sort of death will you have when I destroy the sun?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Neither. I'm not a god.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">I'm a guardian, a servant, and a weapon.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">I have power and knowledge far surpassing a god.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">But I am not one.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is this when you are going to tell me why you want to die?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I sense it's not just because you're getting bored with immortality.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">That's good. Your vision is becoming clearer.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then why?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">My master can't enter this universe until I am killed.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Such is the nature of the break.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That almost sounds like martyrdom. Are you sure it won't be a hero's death?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Quite sure.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">My master is a very evil man.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Who is he?</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">I won't tell you his name.</span>
<span style="color: #ffffff">But he goes by the title, </span><span style="color: #2ed73a">L</span><img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/o.gif" border="0" /><span style="color: #2ed73a">rd English</span><span style="color: #ffffff">.</span>
