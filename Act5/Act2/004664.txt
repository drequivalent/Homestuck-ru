It seems the child's lusus was slain in the collision. He will grow up an orphan, just like you.

This adult alien male appears to be taking on the role of his custodian, instead of killing the boy outright. What a fascinating culture. 

The fellow retrieves the lusus carcass. This appears to be a gentleman who knows better than to let good pony meat go to waste.
