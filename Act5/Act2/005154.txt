You size up the arcane contraption. The blue flicker of the coat's lining is arresting. But you don't know it's a coat. That would only invite more questions. You don't know what it shields. Nor do you know whose shoulders it was meant to cover. If you knew that - if you even knew his name - you would understand terror no human ever has.

You should really listen to Karkat and turn it off. If you start messing with it, I will seriously start fucking everything up. It would be irresponsible of both of us to let that happen.

You suddenly wonder where Jadesprite went. You wonder that because I said you did. I know where she went. But I will not say.

Not that you can hear a word I'm saying.

The coat's too thick.
