<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but now they don't have dream selves left!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: who ever goes will be risking their life for good, won't they?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THAT WOULD BE THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF THOSE FACTS, YES.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: this is unacceptable!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: couldn't i do it?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i am apparently immortal, because of this god tier business, so the bomb probably would not kill me!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OK, BUT DON'T YOU THINK THERE'S A REMOTE POSSIBILITY THAT GOING ON A SUICIDE MISSION TO SAVE ALL OF REALITY WOULD COUNT AS A HEROIC DEATH?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hmm...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: maybe i could try to be not all that brave while i do it?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU ASSHOLE, OF COURSE YOU'D BE BRAVE. THAT TENDS TO BE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING REALLY FUCKING COURAGEOUS.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i just don't want to lose anybody else is all.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS. I'VE LOST FRIENDS FOR WAY MORE POINTLESS REASONS. YOU'RE ALL OUT OF OPTIONS HERE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU'D BE RISKING DEATH JUST AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD, AND THEY'RE BETTER QUALIFIED TO HANDLE THE MISSION AS THE DERSE DREAMERS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: JADE'S DREAM SELF IS DEAD TOO, SO SHE'S OUT. OR TO BE MORE SPECIFIC, HER DREAM SELF IS AN OVERLY EMOTIONAL DOG WHO WENT OFF WHIMPERING SOMEWHERE. I'M PRETTY SURE SHE WILL BE COMPLETELY USELESS.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: she mentioned something about that. she said she prototyped her dream self?? what happened with that?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT. KIND OF A SORE SUBJECT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SHE THINKS SHE'S SELFISH AND COMPLETELY HYSTERICAL AND I GUESS HATES THE PART OF HERSELF SHE REPRESENTS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT I MEAN, THE THING IS SHE SPENT A LONG TIME BEING DEAD AND MOVING ON, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST BRING SOMEBODY BACK AND EXPECT THEM TO GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ALL THE STUFF YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I'VE TRIED TO TELL HER THAT HER SPRITE SELF IS PROBABLY NOWHERE NEAR AS DESPICABLE AS SHE'S MAKING OUT WITH HERSELF TO BE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I MEAN</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: MAKING HERSELF OUT TO BE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ...</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WE'VE ALL GOT FLAWS, EVEN HER</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND FOR ALL THE SHIT SHE'S GIVEN ME ON THIS VERY SUBJECT, SHE KEEPS HERSELF DANGLING FROM A VERY HIGH HOOK.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SHE'D BE DOING ME A MAJOR PERSONAL SOLID BY MAKING AT LEAST SOME ATTEMPT TO GET HERSELF OFF.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WAIT</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: FUCK</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT DID I JUST SAY</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wow.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I MEANT LET HERSELF OFF.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THE HOOK. THE FUCKING HOOK, IT'S A FIGURE OF GODDAMN SPEECH.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: /raises eyebrows</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: PUT THOSE THE BACK DOWN, BEFORE MY HOT ACID RAGEBREATH BURNS THEM OFF YOUR IDIOTIC FACE.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, i am putting them back down as not suggestively as possible.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT WERE WE EVEN TALKING ABOUT, IT WASN'T THIS, WHATEVER THIS IS.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what is what this is?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT'S NOTHING, YOU SHIT. IT HAS BEEN THE CONVERSATIONAL EQUIVALENT OF US WHISTLING THROUGH OUR SNORT BARRELS WHILE TOUCHING EACH OTHER INAPPROPRIATELY.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: was...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: was that another weird erotic slip of the tongue?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: NO, THAT WAS ME BEING WORKED UP INTO THIS RIDICULOUS FUCKING CONNIPTION AND SAYING SOMETHING INFLAMMATORY, GOD. HOW DOES THAT NOT BE CLEAR BY NOW???</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, well,</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what i am getting from this, aside from the possibility that jade may or may not have kissed dog jade at some point, is that neither of them will be able to help with the bomb plan.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT! THE PAJAMA PRODIGY USED HIS PUZZLE SPONGE TODAY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BESIDES, JADE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHER IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE PLAN.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: FOR ONE THING, YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR HER TO SEND YOU THE CODE FOR THE QUILLS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU CAN'T SCRATCH THE MESA WITHOUT THEM.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SHE GOT THEM FROM HER DENIZEN, OR WILL LATER ON HER TIMELINE, NOW THAT SHE LIT THE FORGE AND WOKE THE MONSTER UP.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: aren't those the really tough to kill guys?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: did she kill him?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HELL IF I KNOW, HER EXPLANATION OF THE ENTIRE ENCOUNTER BOILED DOWN TO AND I QUOTE &quot;</span><span style="color: #4ac925">shenanigans</span><span style="color: #626262">&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: LIMED FOR INFURIATINGLY VAGUE.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: haha.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: ANYWAY, AFTER SHE GIVES THAT TO YOU, SHE THEN HAS TO GO THROUGH WITH THE REST OF THE PLAN, WHICH IS MAKING SURE YOU ALL SURVIVE AFTER THE SCRATCH, MINUS ONE OF THE DERSE DREAMERS OF COURSE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THE PLAN REVOLVES AROUND SOME REALLY BAFFLING HAND WAVEY MUMBO JUMBO WHICH I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND, BUT SHE TOLD ME TO TRUST HER ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE INFO COMES FROM A &quot;</span><span style="color: #ffffff">Reliable informant.</span><span style="color: #626262">&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHITENED FOR SMUG TOOL.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT INVOLVES SOMETHING TO DO WITH A YELLOW LAWN RING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHICH ISN'T THE HUMAN WORD FOR IT, IT'S JUST YOUR WORD IS SO DUMB I FEEL DUMB SAYING IT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: word for what?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I GUESS YOUR ENTIRE ESCAPE PLAN SOMEHOW PIVOTS CRITICALLY AROUND AN UNWATERED PIECE OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY???</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT MEANS. JADE SAYS SHE HAS THIS FIGURED OUT, AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO MUCH BUT TRUST HER.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THE POINT IS, SHE'S ALL BOOKED UP, AND ALL TOO MORTAL. SO SHE WON'T BE DELIVERING THE BOMB, AND NEITHER WILL YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, well what about this.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: since she is mortal, and i am not (sort of), and i don't need to do the scratch for a while, can i go help her?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: maybe she could use some protection? maybe that is what dave was just trying to do, when he temporarily died.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: remember, jack is still on the loose! he has killed rose and dave once, and me twice.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: NO NO NO NO NO NO.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SWEET BLEEDING JEGUS, EGBERT, YOU KEEP BRAGGING ABOUT YOUR IMMORTALITY, AND THEN BRAINLESSLY ANNOUNCE PLANS TO GO OFF AND DO SOMETHING HEROIC! YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SHORTEST LIFESPAN OF ANY IMMORTAL IN HISTORY.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: sorry. :(</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BESIDES, IT'S A TOTAL NON ISSUE. JACK WOULDN'T HESITATE TO STAB YOU AGAIN, BUT HE WON'T HURT JADE FOR SOME REASON.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IF ANYTHING, YOU COULD USE HER PROTECTION.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: really?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I NEVER NOTICED WHEN LOOKING THROUGH HER TIMELINE EARLIER. IT WASN'T UNTIL I WAS TALKING TO HER IN THOSE TIMEFRAMES AND SHE TOLD ME. HE JUST KEEPS FOLLOWING HER AROUND. I CAN SEE HIM OFF IN THE DISTANCE IN SOME FRAMES, JUST LURKING THERE, SHADOWING HER MOVEMENTS. IT'S INCREDIBLY DISTURBING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HE LINGERS AROUND HER UNTIL THE SCRATCH BEGINS AND I LOSE THE FEED, NEVER ONCE DOING ANYTHING THREATENING. SHE SAYS SHE THINKS IT'S BECAUSE JACK INHERITED LOYALTY OF HER LUSUS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IF SHE'S RIGHT, I GUESS HER LUSUS REALLY DID OFFER HER THE MOST PROTECTION POSSIBLE BY PROTOTYPING ITSELF, ALBEIT BY DOOMING US ALL. THE IDIOT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: d'aw, that's actually kinda cute.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SADLY, HE HOLDS NO SUCH LOYALTY TO ANY OF US HERE. HE REGARDS US ALL AS RIPE FOR THE REPEATED SKEWERING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OH FUCK, MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE ALL JUST DRESSED LIKE JADE?? I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS STROKE OF GENIUS ONLY OCCURRED TO ME NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i don't think he would be fooled. dogs have pretty good senses of smell.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT WAS</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: A MOTHERFUCKING</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: JOKE</span>
