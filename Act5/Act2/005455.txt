You successfully suppress all thoughts of delicious little wrapped wieners and infuriating things like mail and its agents of delivery. 

But in the process you awaken your deepest and darkest feelings of all. Feelings of...

Loyalty? How completely despicable.

But no, that is not quite all there is.

Could it also be...

LOVE?

It must be. It is the only emotion that could possibly make you feel so utterly disgusted with yourself.
