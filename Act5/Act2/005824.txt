<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i've missed the heck out of him.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: though i'm not sure why. he should be safe at home right now.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i guess i must have lost track of him. but i don't remember how.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: all i know is i have this feeling like i should run over and give him a hug.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Well, just so you know, he is pro8a8ly not actually there.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Kind of like how my lusus was just a memory.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: are you a psychic alien? like the one who jodie foster met in contact, and assumed the form of her dead father to talk to her?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: As a matter of fact, yes, I am a psychic alien. 8ut that has nothing to do with this!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: These are our memories, and we are in the afterlife. I keep trying to tell you, and it's starting to get frustr8ing.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i see. so it is not me who is jodie foster. it's more like you are jodie, because nobody believed her when she came home and had amazing tales to tell.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: except matthew mcconaughey.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Aaaaaaaargh!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: but it's ok. i will be your matt mcconaughey.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Does that mean you'll 8elieve me now?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i guess i always did, sort of.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i think i've been in denial about what's happening here.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It's nice that you 8elieve me. 8ut that doesn't mean you remem8er yet.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: so if this isn't my dad, then where is he?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: He died too. You saw his 8ody. Don't you at least remem8er that?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: no. not at all.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i am remembering a bunch of things, but not that.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Then what?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Do you remem8er me yet?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: no.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i only remember when you contacted me and said you'd kill me a little earlier.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: but that was months ago.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i do remember talking to some other trolls like you.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: and playing this game. it was on my 13th birthday. i was really looking forward to playing it, but it was late in the mail.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i got some presents from my dad. like this big weird clown doll that i didn't like much.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: and some fruit gushers...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: oh yeah! i also realized gushers were made by betty crocker. that freaked me the fuck out!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: did YOU realize betty crocker makes gushers???</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: This comes as news to me.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: well she does. her villainy knows no bounds.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: oh.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: he also gave me this suit, which i remember wearing for a while.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: but it didn't look quite like this.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: it had a black tie, and no ghost, so i improved it.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: actually...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i remember dying in a suit.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You do?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: but</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: this was not the suit i was wearing when i died.</span>
