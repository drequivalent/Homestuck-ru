<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i guess some captchas are so incomprehensible cause the game thinks it would be too cheap to let you duplicate them</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: like an anti piracy measure</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so the solution to the anti piracy measure is to override the anti spam measure</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: anti spam?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: well yeah thats what captchas are for</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and theyre on the back of cards for a really good reason</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: cause god knows the last thing youd want was some web bot being able to figure out the code for like</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: a potted plant</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: that would be fucking mayhem</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah obviously!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but in order to effectively cheat here weve got to open pandoras spam box</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and release the laserstation into the world with its leering intellibeam</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: now no captcha is safe youll have bots signing up for email accounts and duplicating potted plants and shit</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh nooo</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: basically robots are in control now</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: which is good news and bad news</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the bad news is theyre all pornbots and theyve got LOADS of provocative material theyre just dying to share with us</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: whats the good news?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: thats also the good news</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: dave i still dont know what youre actually doing here</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: whats it look like</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im duplicating my server disc</span>
