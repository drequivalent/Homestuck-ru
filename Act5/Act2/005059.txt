You grab one of your grandpa's softest trophies and use it to make a really stylish WARM FUZZY SQUIDDLEJACKET!

You do the exact same thing to your shoes to create a matching pair of SQUIDDLESNEAKS! 

The jacket and the shoes are ALSO computers. You will never be caught without a computer, ever.

You are suddenly feeling more fashionable than any kid in paradox space. All of the style belongs to you. The only thing left to do is make yourself deadlier.
