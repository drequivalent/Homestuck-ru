<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ok, i appreciate the THOUGHT of an apology, but i dont know if it really counts if you are just going to pawn off responsibility on your &quot;past self&quot; again!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: maybe your &quot;present self&quot; should own up to it!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING.</span>
