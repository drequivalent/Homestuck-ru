<span style="color: #005682">AG: I guess I have to admit I don't actually know that much a8out humans either!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Other than that you are all pretty soft and mild mannered and seem to 8e friendlier, and think killing totally sucks.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I really have no clue what it means to grow up as a human, though.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut I do know what it means grow up as a troll, and what's expected of us.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what does it mean?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: When a troll comes of age, you 8etter 8elieve it means they're going to start killing.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It's what we do as a race. We are very effective conquerors, and as such, we practically domin8 our galaxy. Or... used to.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: The ones that don't learn to 8e ruthless? They're 8etter off DEAD.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And the reality is, it won't 8e long until they are. That's just life for us.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that sounds terrible!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i would like to be culturally sensitive, but i wish it didn't have to be like that for you.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i have started to really like you guys!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Well, thanks John. That's nice of you to say. 8ut let's face it, it doesn't fucking matter anymore, since our whole race was wiped out!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: May8e for the 8est, when you think a8out it.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: :(</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut at least paradox space gave us some purpose 8efore wiping us out, right?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: At least we got the chance to cre8te you guys, and all those twinkly stars you used to look up at.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, that's true.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So 8ecause we got that chance, it means we'll never actually get to come of age and enter troll society, and see if we got what it takes.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut that doesn't mean we stop growing up!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I think the game knows it's always gonna 8e played 8y kids, and it always rigs it so they enter right around the cusp of sexual maturity, whatever the race is.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Which kinda makes sense, since if they succeed, they've got their whole lives ahead of them to do whatever the hell they're going to do in their universe, like start repopul8ing and whatnot.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: That means the game also knows it's got to deal with all these damn kids who are coming of age while playing it!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I really think how successfully they mature is tied to success in the game. It challenges the players in all the ways they need to 8e challenged to grow, which is different for every individual, and veeeeeeeery different for every race.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I don't think we were so hot at that aspect of the game. In fact, I'm sure we were quite awful. Hell, even I wasn't that gr8 at it! I actually just kinda fell ass 8ackwards into the god tier, to 8e honest.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hehe... yeah me too. :)</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut what really gets me is this didn't even occur to me until just now, while I was sitting around thinking a8out it.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It was so o8vious!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: That was why the game split us up into two teams.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It knew as we came of age, we'd pro8a8ly start killing each other.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So it just provided the stage. Red team vs. 8lue. It was so simple! All we had to do was what we were naturally inclined to. It might have worked out 8etter for us.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: uh...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i don't really see how you guys killing each other would help you play the game better!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah, you'd think that would 8e counter productive! 8ut then again, may8e not.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: If we really did take the team thing seriously, and started killing each other, may8e it would have meant more god tiers?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: May8e all of us would have made it????????</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Damn, can you imagine? We would have 8reezed through the game even faster, killed the king without a sweat. May8e claimed the reward 8efore Jack even showed up?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Or if he did, may8e we could have 8eaten him then and there instead of scurrying off like cowards!!!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: In retrospect we failed at this so spectacularly, I am amazed, and kind of ashamed.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It turned out that the only one of us with the guts to kill someone was already DEAD! Hahahahahahahaha. And 8oy, did I have it coming.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: dead?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yes, she was a ghost, and then 8ecame a ro8ot. Then she 8ecame a THOUSAND ro8ots. Then Jack killed them all 8ut one. Then she 8lew up.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Oh, and she also had that exact 8izarre laptop you are using right now. How weird is that?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: gosh...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: your team is so crazy!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Not crazy enough, apparently!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Actually, this is pro8a8ly Karkat's fault.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: how?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: When it comes down to it, he was pro8a8ly too good a leader! He actually did manage to get the two teams to work together toward the same goal. It could have easily deterior8ed into a feud otherwise.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: He was just so loud and annoying and o8sessed with leadership. He wouldn't shut up! So it was just easier to go along with his plans.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: huh...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, i can see how that could be true.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: He sure kept us working together, 8ut in the end I think we paid for it.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It wasn't natural! Pretty fitting, really, since he's kind of a freak himself. He's not even on the hemospectrum, the weirdo.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I really dou8t he would have handled it as a leader if the shit ever hit the whirling device.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: He likes to pretend he's all vicious and 8loodthirsty, 8ut I know he 8n't got that in him. I have a sense for these things.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: He'd 8e so pissed if he heard me say this, 8ut I think he'd cut it 8etter as a human than as a troll.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: you probably mean that as an insult, but i think it is a nice compliment!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i won't tell him you said it, heheheh.</span>
