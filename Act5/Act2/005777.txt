<span style="color: #e00707">TG: this huge fuckin whopper im about to just say</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You mean a canard of behemothic embellishment?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Or was your resolve finally dismantled by the siren's song of all that flame broiled beef?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no no</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok first do you even have burger kings out in the fucking woods</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: why do you reference things that obviously arent in the woods like terrible burgers</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'll limit my establishments of reference to lumber mills and sugar shanties from now on.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Also, there's a Burger King less than forty minutes from my house. I won't let this stand in the way of the new policy though.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: there is</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok whatever</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im talking about a dream i just had</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i mean it was a doozy like psychologically speaking</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: doozy is a slightly dumber word than whopper</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Certainly less delicious.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it was absurdly heavy handed my subconscious was really slathering it on</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: like whatever tangy sludge the king himself squirts on his bargain patties</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: its possible that i dreamt it ironically i dunno</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i figured youd be interested in hearing about it its every bit as thick and juicy as a half pound of sizzling grade A premium ok this is stupid weve got to get burgers out of this conversation</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: are you busy</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: cool listen to this</span>
