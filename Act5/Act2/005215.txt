<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh god, it is still a frogcicle!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: this will not do</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Problem Isnt That The Frog Is Still Frozen</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Problem Is That You Were Able To Appearify It At All</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Ectobiology Is Based Entirely On Your Inability To Appearify A Subject</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i dont understand!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but i am intrigued...</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: If That Frog Were Destined To Do Something Else</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Such As Become Ensnared In Your Net Later</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: You Would Not Be Able To Appearify It Because That Would Cause A Paradox</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: So Instead You Would Appearify Its Slime Imprint</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Paradox Slime Is What Is Important Here</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: You Can Mix It With The Slime From Other Paradoxically Appearified Frog Imprints</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Study The Genes And Selectively Combine</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Then Create Resulting Paradox Clones</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ok, that makes sense i think</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: how can i appearify some frog slime?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: You Will Need To Direct The Terminal To Another Frog</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Then You Must Be Sure Later To Interfere With That Frog In Some Way</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: For Instance By Planning To Venture Out To Capture That Exact Frog As I Suggested Earlier</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: That Way It Will Be Impossible To Appearify The Frog Before Your Interference Has Taken Place</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Only Its Slime Will Arrive</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: so it is like</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: a sort of backwards frog breeding</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: clone first, catch later?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes</span>
