<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i mean, dont you remember what this was all about?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: what you were working for... what WE were working for all those years before you died?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: remember what we saw in the clouds, or what the queen told us?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: uh...</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: how could you not remember john survived?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: we both saw him in a cloud! he was in his dream suit and awake, reading our letter!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: didnt you think about that?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: ummmm, so? what does it matter?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: ...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: it was all a lie jade. what we saw in the clouds and all that. none of it meant anything</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: what!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: how can you SAY that?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: it was a nice life, but everything we did lead to nothing</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: john and i both died, and i eventually accepted that and moved on</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: JOHN DIDNT DIE!!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: omg...</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: this is so frustrating, i just told you he didnt</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i knew i was kind of ditzy and forgetful in my dreams, but</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: boooo ho-</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: SHHHHH! okaaaaaay, jeez!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i just dont know what to think</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i guess you are part of me, and you are who i was when i slept</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but it makes me sad to think i would act like this</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: act like what?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i would like to think that even if i was sad and scared, if i was put in a position where everyone depended on me, i could put all those feelings aside and do whats right!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: but i dont know whats right</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yes you do!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: even though you dont want to be, youre here now, and there are still people who need you</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: there is still something worth fighting for!</span>
