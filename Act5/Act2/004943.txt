<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It is set to detonate precisely when the reckoning ends.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This is how long we have to put this plan into motion.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what the hell is a bomb doing in there</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It could be a feature of any session not meant to bear fruit.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: A means to wipe out a null session rather than leaving it lingering in paradox space for eternity.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Or it could be a mutation specific to our session.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I really don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: first time for everything i guess</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: seriously whered you get all this info</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: did you get it all from the gods</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: are these just a bunch of orders youre following</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Not exactly.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: They've urged me in certain directions and guided my exploration.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've obtained some answers from them, but ultimately, this idea is mine.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Plus, I have other sources.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: One in particular has been quite illuminating.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've been referring to him as an informant, when people ask.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Which isn't often.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what you mean a troll</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: No.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's a man who exists in another universe.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: He wants to die.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: sounds like a really credible dude sign me up for trusting everything he says</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Only as credible as the omniscient tend to be.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh so he knows everything</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yeah, I think that's what omniscient means.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But maybe I'll ask him about that, since he's the omniscient one.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: even if he is omniscient which he probably isnt what if hes just lying</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: He says he doesn't lie.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: For some reason, I believe him about that.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: He's a convincing fellow.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: whys he want to die</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: He no longer has a purpose now that he's done everything required to summon his master.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: As a first guardian, he's completely indestructible.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Well, almost completely.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: wait</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: His power is derived from the same source as Earth's guardian.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And conveniently, that of our nemesis as well.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok i get it now</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: When John delivers the tumor,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And I do mean </span><span style="color: black">The Tumor</span><span style="color: #b536da">,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I and I alone will navigate the Furthest Ring.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And I will destroy the sun.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: By which I do mean the <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/greenmotherfuckingsun.gif" border="0" />.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And in case it wasn't clear,</span>
