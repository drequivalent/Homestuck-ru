<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I am piloting the moon through the Furthest Ring right now.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: At the moment, it's passing through a dream bubble. I am visiting your dream in person.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Or, you are the one visiting me as I travel, in your sleep. If you'd rather look at it that way.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so all those questions you asked me</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: getting me to remember</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you were just stalling me werent you</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so i wouldnt wake up and try to stop you</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Not entirely.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: this sucks</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: could you just please turn the thing around and come back</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm already out here. Might as well go through with it.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: we agreed id do it though</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or at least you pretended to agree</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: just before going into a major league wind up with your nap yarn</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: A major league wind up?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: sports</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's always been pretty sad that I seem to know more about sports than you. Which is really saying something.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: all im saying is</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no one likes a basketball hog</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's probably just &quot;ball hog.&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i just think you should know</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: that in the athletic arena of competitive achievement</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: its a widely known fact that cherry picking posers get showered in nothin but boos</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you dont gank the rock and steal the big mans thunder on his raucus drive to the hole</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh lord.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: is that the sort of ignominy you want</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: see you didnt consider sports you never consider the sports</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The last thing I want to do is come between a big man's thunder and any particular hole he might prize.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and yet</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: such has been whats happened</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it like the tight end was going long down the yard in sudden death</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: its me im the tight end</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and the quarterback sniped the fieldgoal just before the nfl buzzer went off</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the greedy qb is you</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's not even close to being a thing in football.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but instead of winning the gold sports prize you just fucking die and nobody cares and it didnt mean anything</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Which prize is that?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the football prize</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You mean the most vaunted accolade associated with the gridiron, known as &quot;Stanley's Cup?&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no come on</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: its called the bruce bombardi trophy or something</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: for best pile squad</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'll take your word for it.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and even though youre dead all these fat millionaires in helmets just leap on your corpse anyway and pile up and i mean WAY up</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: How high do they even have to be?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the sport pile doesnt stop from getting taller</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Does the officiator have a means of measurement on hand?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I wouldn't want to be crushed by a nonregulation sport pile.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what do you care youll be dead like the mission thieving poser you are</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Poser?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So not cool.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yes poser it should be my torso getting pulverized by that avalanche of overpaid beefcakes and you know it</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I forget what we were doing exactly.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Were we pursuing the hackneyed debate over who has the best claim to self sacrifice,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Or seeing who can out-dumbass the other with obtuse sports lingo?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: there obviously stopped being a difference between those things the question is offensive</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: almost as offensive as you stalling me while you peel out of here in your dumb moon</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm the one stalling?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The moon is probably just a speck in the sky now due to your strange beefcake harangue.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah but i dont know how to wake back up is the thing</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: how do i wake back up</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess I could wake back you up, if you really want.</span>
