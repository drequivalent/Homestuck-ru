<span style="color: #626262">CG: I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A SPECIAL POINT OF NOT BEING THE ONE TO TELL YOU, I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU THE SATISFACTION.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hey, shut up a second!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i need you to be nice for a change and do me a favor...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: have you talked to jade recently?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: can you tell me what happened to her??</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: uh...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hmm.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: JOHN, THE FACT THAT YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO THINK I CAN READ YOUR MIND JUST UNDERSCORES WHAT A HARROWING GODDAMN IDIOT YOU ARE.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">CG: NO, NOT &quot;COOL&quot;.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IS VERY MUCH ANTITHETICAL TO YOUR PRIMITIVE HUMAN NOTION OF &quot;EARTH COOL&quot;.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU SEE, IN OUR FIRST CONVERSATION, WE DIDN'T EXACTLY GET OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT IS A FOOT WHICH SHOULD HAVE REEKED OF YOUR VERBAL RUINATION.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT INSTEAD IT SMELLED LIKE</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WELL, LET'S NOT GET INTO THAT.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">CG: NOBODY CRIES, EXCEPT YOUR SHITTY GHOST. HEAVY SOBS FROM A SPECTER OF UNQUALIFIED FAILURE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT IS A SYMPHONY TO MY ANGRY EARS.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so... the smell is from a foot... but also from funeral flowers?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: this metaphor is confusing.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: STFU</span>
