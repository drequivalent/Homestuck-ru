<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Good gravy. Those are exotic circumstances!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And here i was thinking i had the most exciting and adventurous life. It turns out im just some chump on boring ass monster island in the silly old PRE apocalypse.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: For what it's worth, I think it's gotta be more interesting living in the 21st century than the 25th.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like it's really no contest.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Youre probably right.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Id be really keen on talking to roxy about this too!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im very curious about her experiences as a future lady with all the whatsits. The hard shell folk.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I must say it turns my previous perception of your lives right on its friggin ear.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Man, she would love to talk to you about all this.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She hates keeping secrets. It's been killing her not to spill all these fucking beans way the hell prematurely.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Like what is even your day to day business like in sea hitlers water apocalypse??</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, I mostly shit around in my apartment all day, building stuff, reading about history, and flipping out with my sword.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sometimes I go fishing and check out the underwater ruins.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She does plenty of useless fucking around too, but at least she's got a neighborhood.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She also uses one of her gadgets to gank vegetables and stuff from the past.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She tries to feed the hungry neighbors whatever she can scrounge up.</span>
