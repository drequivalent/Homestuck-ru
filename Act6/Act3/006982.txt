<span style="color: #929292">UU: i can see that yoU are preoccUpied with aggressors at the moment.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt yoUr viewport is beginning to black oUt more freqUently.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i wanted to talk to yoU one last time before yoU enter, and yoUr whole session blacks oUt for good.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and before...</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: well, before i possibly do the same. U_U;</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am sorry to hear yoU're feeling Under the weather.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt now i am wondering. hm.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: coUld it have been that regUlar intake of yoUr soporific liqUids was inhibiting yoUr commUnion with the void, rather than exaggerating them as i had presUmed?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if the effects are wearing off, it coUld explain the increase in viewport blackoUts.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and once they wear off completely, perhaps that is why yoUr entire session goes dark on yoUr entry.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: that is an interesting theory that has like</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: mostly no usefull bearing on anything probably?</span>
