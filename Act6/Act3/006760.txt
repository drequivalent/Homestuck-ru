<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But she must have been the first to understand how dangerous the Baroness was, while acting in covert opposition.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Others would follow, and continue to as of now, in your time period.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: These are your ancestors?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, mine and Roxy's were among them.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Anyone ive heard of?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Of course. All these fuckers are totally famous, obviously.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh sure obviously.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We've talked about the guy I'm genetically derived from a lot actually.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like, you know, every time I've ever talked about my bro?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Gadzooks of course!!!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: With all your future mindfuckery you made me completely forget about your vaunted hollywood sibling.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I shoulda asked where he fit into the picture if you were raised alone. I can be dumb as a bag of penny candy sometimes.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sometimes.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Other times you're on point, like a bag of the nickel shit.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whoa now those are the sweets kept in reserve for millionaires. Such flattery!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, what we're sayin' stopped meaning anything, so I'll continue.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Right. So then he was never actually your bro?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, that's just kind of how I view him.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Lalonde took a more maternal view of her ancestor.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: The lady who wrote all the dreary wizard books i presume?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, the CotL series. Ever read it?</span>
