<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: well ty for finally confiding in me calilope</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *calliope sorrey</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU're welcome. it is good to get it off my chest.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i am primarily telling yoU this as a last resort, in hopes of saving myself.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU see, this rUle between me and my brother is a kind of trUce.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: we have both agreed not to say oUr names to anyone so that things will not get oUt of hand, and so it became one of the rUles.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if anyone were to say his name to me, i woUld immediately fall asleep, and he woUld wake Up.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so yoU will Understand if i refrain from telling yoU his as well. ~_u</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hes sleeping now?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes, fortUnately for both of Us.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now, chronologically speaking, i have never contacted yoU after this moment.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so if i never wake Up from my next nap, yoU will never hear from me again.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if yoU do not hear from me later, i woUld very mUch appreciate it if yoU coUld message my brother, and say my name.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it may be the only chance i have to wake Up again.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: fuuuck</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: this is highly terrible and scary stuff youre saying</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is overwhelming, trying to be cavalier aboUt rUles i have respected all my life. i'm not sUre where to begin.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: well</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what i wonder is</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you said you couldnt have romantic feelings</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: or &quot;red relations&quot; as you said in your trolly way</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh, i can have romantic feelings.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: jUst not the flUshed kind, which hUmans describe as romantic love.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok but</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i didnt think that was alien to you</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: not the way u made it sound</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like dont trolls have the 4 kinds and one kind is just staight up love feelins</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes, that's right.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt...</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh bUgger. this is so embarrassing to have to admit.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am sorry for saying things which may have reasonably led yoU to believe this.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: probably way too many things. u_u;</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i am not actUally a troll.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: o</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: rrrrrelay</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: i have spent so mUch time wishing i coUld be one.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: trolls are a remarkable and fascinating race.</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i am oUt and oUt smitten with trolls and their history and ways.</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: and they are so beaUtifUl.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i wish i coUld be that pretty.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: UnfortUnately, i am not very attractive at all.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: sad to say, no one woUld kiss the corpse i will leave behind.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: even if there were someone aroUnd to revive me, i doUbt they woUld be inclined to bother.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: for, er... several reasons, actUally.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt really, it was always for the best that i cannot have fUlly flUshed feelings.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: no one coUld ever love me.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: oh man no!!!</span>
