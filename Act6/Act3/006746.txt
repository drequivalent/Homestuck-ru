<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh cool. It worked.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hehe. You nerd.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hes got your slick japanese spectacles and everything.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why is this a metal man before me or is it none other than dirk strider himself in my room??</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: One thing at a time, bro. I haven't quite figured out a way to get myself there yet.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It almost sounds like this is something youve given some thought...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok well I don't know what you're implying there but why don't you snap that sucker on the torso and fire it up.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Affirmative.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I continue to boggle vacantly at your technical shenanigans.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Your knack for gadgetry seems to surpass even my grandmas and she was like this big time gizmo legend.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How do you even do this stuff?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess from your perspective I must seem hells of &quot;overpowered&quot; in a bunch of ways.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which I kind of am, like with a ninja sword I'm basically nuts, ok?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: If you say so buddy. I can believe it.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, but when it comes to building stuff you're probably overstating things.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like for example, if you told someone a hundred years ago you could build a computer they'd probably be like whoa shit, look at this fuckin' genius.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well actually first of all they'd say, what's a computer, I only know what horses and diseases are and shit like that.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But once you actually tell them what computers are: Jesus dick! You're a wizard.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But from your perspective you know it's not a big deal to build a computer. You just go online and buy a case and a motherboard and some other shit and put it all together.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's not like you're smelting the goddamn silicon in your basement and making chips in your hermetically sealed, dust-free garage.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yeah but come on its not like youre from a century in the future.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well. No.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Nor am i a quaint man of the past. Pardon me but do i SOUND like some trollycar bellwether toiling in the heart of the mustache belt from the ruff n tumble year of nineteen aught nine???</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: ...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He said unironically.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Give me some credit man and some to yourself as well. You are too modest about all this robotics noise.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't know. I have a lot of time to work on stuff I guess.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There are a lot of irons. You know where they are? Here's a hint. It's a pretty hot place.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: The kitchen?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sure, I keep some irons there too. But most of them are in the fire.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh of course!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Fire is quite notoriously the hottest thing there is. A tip top locale for a whole mess of irons!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: True that.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I actually have so much to do and think about, one of my current projects hopefully will address that very issue.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Gonna make an AI replica of my own mind. He can share some of the load. As well as make a decent intellectual sparring partner, ideally.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not that my conversations with you aren't uniquely rad. But you know what I mean.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: See again i think you are downplaying a pretty neat accomplishment if you ask me.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Shrug. We'll see.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Does that mean I'll have to deal with two dirks?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: One who is MORE MACHINE THAN MAN...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And another who is a computer program you made hahahahahahaha.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's a super joke.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But I'm guessing you won't be hearing much from the program. It probably won't play a significant role in either of our lives.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I have my doubts it'll be a successful project, but who knows.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Id wager a tidy sum the results of the endeavor will be sensational.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I believe in you!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You do?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sure bro. I always have.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You have helped me out a lot and been a good friend for ages.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Hmm.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, I wasn't sure about doing this today, but if it's true that you do believe in me, then I guess fuck it, why not.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why not what?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess call it an extra birthday present. But instead of a present that's awesome, consider it more like a weird confession that may change the way you feel about me.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whoa uh...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dirk are you... uh...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Saying what i think?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What do you think I'm saying here?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Uh never mind sorry for interrupting.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Should i sit down for this i dont know what to do.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait i already am sitting down. Maybe i should stand up?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, just chill out. Stand up, sit down, whatever. Here's the thing.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You know all these painfully obvious hints I've been dropping? That always seem to be flying over your head?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ummmmmmmm.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Maybe?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think i need a towel or something.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: About me being from the future.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh. Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think so.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well those weren't jokes. It's true.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What? Oh man are you actually serious??</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So like...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You ARE from a century in the future.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No. More like four centuries.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The year 2422.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or as we say contemporarily, 411 P.C.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Post Condescension.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: WOW.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I must say this is not the announcement i was expecting.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So you are a time traveler from 2422 here to help me build robots or something?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, I can't time travel. I can only send things through time, occasionally.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I actually live here in the future, alone in my apartment. I can send messages to you in the past though, like I'm doing now.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Years ago our alien friend sent me a special chat client. It's basically just Pesterchum, with some sort of alien technology embedded.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's specifically wired to communicate with your time period. As hours go by for me, the time it sends messages to also increments by the same amount, so we communicate in lockstep. As if we both existed in the present.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She said it was important for Roxy and I to begin communicating with you and Jane. This is how we all became friends.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait... you and roxy?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes. She lives in the future too. Though we live nowhere near each other.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I asked her to refrain from telling either of you. I wanted to be the one to let you know. To wait for the right moment.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Holy fucking mackerel. This is amazing!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So,</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You really are trusting me about this? Just like that? No second thought?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well yeah. Sure man why not? Wait its not a prank is it?!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This would be a very shitty and boring &quot;prank.&quot; I promise it isn't.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Then heck yes i believe it to friggin pieces. Its an awesome thing to be true!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Haha.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So whats the far flung future like? Some sort of crazy robo paradise?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not quite, but there are definitely robots.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh man what are your movies like in the future?? I bet there are some real cinematic humdingers. Like holographic stuff? Or shit you plug directly into your brain pod right? Wait you do have brain pods right?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No. We don't have brain pods because those aren't a thing, you just made that up. And there are no movies in the future.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There are no humans either. They all went extinct.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Roxy and I are the only ones left, as far as we know.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well shit.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dirk this story got so much less awesome.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Is it too late to backpedal on believing it before i start to cry?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No dude, it's too late. Tears ahoy, this motherfucker gets sad.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you want to know what happened?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sure do.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Lemme just finish putting this steel melon on my brobot and then im all ears...</span>
