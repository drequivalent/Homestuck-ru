<span style="color: #929292">UU: i doUbt i am what yoU're pictUring.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt aside from a few sUperficial similarities, we are very different from trolls and hUmans.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: we are not a social race. we generally will not ever encoUnter another of oUr kind, Unless it is time to mate.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and when that time comes, oUr coUrtship is nothing like it is for hUmans.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is highly confrontational and violent.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: sounds so lonely</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: plus w/ hecks of tricky sex</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is lonely.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt that is in oUr natUre, to be alone. jUst as it is to find attraction throUgh contempt.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now that i think aboUt it, i shoUld have known.</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: i believed he and i coUld play together, even Under oUr UniqUe biological circUmstances.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i was so daft, i thoUght skaia had actUally made an exception for Us.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and that we coUld overcome oUr conflicts, work together, and fUlfill the game's minimUm reqUirement of two players. one of space and the other of time.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i was always fooling myself.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is now clear only one of Us will sUrvive.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: my skaian visions have misled me.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: or i have blinded myself to their trUe meaning.</span>
