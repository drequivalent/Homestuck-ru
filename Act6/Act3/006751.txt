<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Pretty sure the Carapacians took care of her when she was young.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait the whatsits?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Right. Another thing I forgot to mention.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There are a lot of these humanoid creatures with hard shells. Some black, some white.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: As humanity was dwindling due to an increasingly whimsical and psychopathic Condesce, she began introducing more of these Carapacians on to the scene.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Are they aliens too?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Uh...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sort of. They are definitely from other planets, so, yeah. Really the deal with where they came from is a whole other story for another time.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But the bottom line is at some point, somehow, she started herding a bunch of them from their home worlds on to Earth and multiplying them.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Something like a hundred years ago it became clear she favored these guys more than humans as her subjects.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They're very loyal and seem genuinely dedicated to serving her. Must be what they were bred for. She still treats them like shit though, unsurprisingly.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: All these colonies started sprouting up. Like these modular cities floating on the water.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It probably sounds cooler than it is. But they're basically slums. That's where they tend to live in large numbers.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Roxy lives in one of these colonies. It's about 2000 miles from where I am.</span>
