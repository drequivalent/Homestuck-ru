<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I will disregard your anomalous observation for now and continue conversing as if it never happened.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Right. Good plan.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Um.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Anyhoo thats a heck of a tragic and thrilling tale dirk.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I am still totally cockeyed and catawampus about it all i dont even know what to think.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But you believe me, right?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh yeah every word of it!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Wow.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why shouldnt i? You are my friend and i trust you.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I still just think it's impressive, is all. Even after all this time. You are pretty much a one of a kind dude.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Heh not really i just like believing stuff and believing in people.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait what do you mean?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: About what?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: When you said after all this time?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You just told me now!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hang on.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Blarg! The deja vuey shit is happening again!!!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Okay i am SURE weve had this conversation before so many things are familiar.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I remember you saying the one of a kind dude thing and i remember saying the word catawampus and...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: All of it!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whats going on?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Took you long enough to figure it out.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Pages really are a slow burning class. Damn.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Figure what out!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're asleep.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Thats right. I fell off the platform thing and i guess i got knocked out?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yep.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So im dreaming.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Kinda.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's a dream bubble.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whats that?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A place in the infinite abyss where sleeping people can share dreams with each other while revisiting memories.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Also where they can meet dead people.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So we are sharing a dream together?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And youre currently asleep too? Uh. Currently in the future?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Even if I was, I wouldn't visit a dream bubble. That only happens when your dream self is dead, like yours is.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Mine is not.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hm. I guess i understand?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So whats the deal then? Wait.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You said this is where they meet dead people too...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Shit! Dirk are you dead? Are you a ghost!?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, dude. Chill. I'm fine.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Then what the fuck is going on! Who am i talking to?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, who are the people you talk to when you have a regular dream?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What? Uh...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like just a boring normal dream, and there's a person you're talking to. Who is that?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont know?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's nobody. Just a projection of your own mind.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dream bubbles don't always need to be shared by dreamers or dead people. You can go to sleep and wake up in one alone, reliving an old memory.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Kind of like a normal dream. Until you remember it's just a memory, which is where we are now.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Okay.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I am having like a lucid dreamy thing in a magic bubble and you are just like a figment of my imagination?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes, basically.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So im talking to myself! Thats kind of stupid!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, yeah. But not quite.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You could view me as a projection of the real Dirk within your mind, as expressed through all of your thought patterns about him.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So I'm kind of a splinter of his corporeal self who happens to live in your awareness.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm a startlingly close approximation to the real thing, for all intents and purposes.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Just how startlingly close are we talking?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm not going to give you a bogus percentage like the glasses cause that's not my shtick.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But pretty damn close.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Okay thats fair.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Man.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: There is something that feels kind of weird about this. You being in my head... its a little messed up!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What's messed up about it?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You were the one who put me here, with your intimate understanding of all his mannerisms and predilections.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And a splintered existence is pretty much how he rolls.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This is how shit is bro.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ok im sorry for saying its messed up but...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its still a bit frustrating! Ive been trying to talk to you all day.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But all i get is your pesky responder bedeviling me at every turn and your friggin robot punching me across the ocean and then throwing a weird tantrum and ripping his nuclear heart out in front of me.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And if that werent enough i tumbled off the doohickey and knocked myself out and now im strolling down memory lane with your fake brain ghost!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its like you are surrounding me from all sides with imitations of yourself but never the REAL YOU!!!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Cheese and fucking crackers when do i just get to talk to the actual dirk?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jake, what do you even know about someone's actual self?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What makes it actual? What is &quot;actuality?&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What a horseshitty question!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont know anything about actuality i guess but i know some philosobabble horseshit when i dadblasted hear it.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm just saying, this isn't really your field of expertise.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dirk is the heart guy. He's the one walking the path of self, even when he doesn't know it. Like right now.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But what does that mean?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And how can you really be made of only my thoughts when i dont even know what youre talking about sometimes?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Or when i didnt know some of the things youre telling me? Like about being in a dream bubble?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How can i tell myself about that stuff through brain ghost dirk!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Who says you don't know those things on some level?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont think i do!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I have no business knowing those things.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Pages have a lot of untapped potential.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's practically all there is to the class, actually.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But when they eventually find it, look out.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And the ones who deal in hope? Shit, man.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm scared of you already, and I'm not even real.</span>
