<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The rumors say it was her own &quot;pet&quot; who killed them.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: See, she traveled from her world to Earth in this huge red space ark.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In it she had gathered thousands of creatures from her planet, I'm guessing to save them from extinction.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This more than anything has led me to speculate that some cataclysm happened on her home world, and she moved on to greener pastures to rebuild her empire.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She bred all these creatures in secret, increasing their numbers, preparing for her eventual takeover.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Each monster, or &quot;lusus naturae,&quot; was meant to be kind of a caretaker of the young. You can see where the dramatic schism between our species and hers begins, and also why she had a reputation for being quite insane.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But she also happens to have this one humongous sea monster lusus that is like her own personal bodyguard, and kind of a secret weapon.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But it turns out the thing is kind of an enigma. Sort of a double edged eldritch horror. As much in her service as it is calling the shots, in some unfathomable way.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Every time she tried to resurrect her race, it would slaughter them all psychically. As if it was keeping her ambition in check.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or so the story goes.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait... these beasts tend to the young??</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I can tell you from first hand experience that monsters are totally rotten at taking care of kids!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: They do a bangup job of making em scared though. :(</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Exactly.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The plan was beyond shitty.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So does that mean you and rox were raised by these things?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nope.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It was a very short lived experiment centuries ago.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Humans just don't have the same evolutionary symbiosis with those things that her race had.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It turns out a bunch of fuckin' alien monsters have no interest whatsoever in taking care of human babies.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They mostly just wound up eating them, or at best, just abandoning them.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Later she instated a lusidroid system to serve the same function, as she began phasing in more robotic solutions in favor of all this ill conceived biotech nonsense that always did nothing but backfire.</span>
