<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: There he is finished.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Look at this spanking iron friend from the future. He is perfect.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh shoot dirk he just got blurry and disappeared! What the actual fuck?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Don't worry, that's normal.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Upon activation he goes into Stalking Mode.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Stalking mode??</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes. He will stalk you in the jungle and strike when your guard is down.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What? Thats crazy why would i want that!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Didn't you want someone to get in scrums with?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well yeah but... man.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He will give you all the scrums you can handle. Trust me, this will sharpen your combat skills.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I guess youre right.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I was just picturing a little good honest rough housing... why does the whole thing have to sound so sketchy and nerve wracking!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you want to hear my grim tales of the apocalypse or not?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Youre right lets put issues of fisticuffs aside for now. Tell me everything about the future.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So how does humanity fuck up? Is it the nuclear holocaust? Or is it robots? Gotta be the robots right? As per the terminator.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, it's more of a gradual decline in population than that, due to an insidious power grab by an aquatic alien empress.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh the old alien overlord story? Got it. When does she show up?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She's already there, in your time period, hiding in plain sight. She has been for anywhere between fifty and a hundred years.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She's the Baroness of Crockercorp. Jane's company. But of course Jane has no idea.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The Baroness has been using subtle strategies to manipulate the human population through her company for a long time.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: On November 11th, 2011, she finally made her presence known to the world, along with her agenda for global domination.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Jeez that is pretty scary. So in a few years she will be in charge of everything?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, not quite. That's just when the world finally sees her for the threat she is. She would continue to gain power by exploiting various institutions and the media from within.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It would take the next several decades for her to claim the throne as Earth's absolute ruler. Her march to domination was facilitated by a number of scumbag sympathizers, and opposed by a few brave rebels, including my ancestor. Roxy's too.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I think your ancestor qualifies as one too. In fact I'm sure she must have been the first member of the covert opposition movement.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: My grandma?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I do remember when i was very young she would tell me stories of the wicked woman who raised her.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Was she the evil alien?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yep.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's a whole story right there, most of which is shrouded in rumor and urban legend.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But before we get sidetracked by any of that, I'll try to cover the big picture. To give you a sense of all the batshit lunacy that followed the sea hag's power play.</span>
