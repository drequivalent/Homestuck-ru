<span style="color: #e00707">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> began pestering <span style="color: #00d5f2">gutsyGumshoe [GG]</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Looks like you're getting the hang of these puzzles.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Nice work.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Thank you!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That last skull was a doozy, to be honest.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yeah, I guess. If you have a human brain, sure.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Personally, I've already solved all conceivable skull puzzles for all possible skull states, which is a thing that's like, no big deal for me?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Har har.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hey, I thought you couldn't see me once I left the house?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I can't. Not through the server's viewport.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But I can still monitor your progress through Lil Sebastian.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He and I are linked the hell up cyberwise. We are so tight. Tight like you wouldn't believe.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh yeah?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It's like he is the Incredible Hulk's pants, and I am his monstrous package yearning to bust loose.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Blehhhh, why??</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Jane.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It seems there is a way bigger than average probability that you do not want to discuss Bruce Banner's megalithic gamma schlong.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That figure would be sitting pretty at one hundred percent.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Holy shit!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Some of my circuits exploded. That number was intense to robo-consider.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ok, let's stop talking about stupid things for a minute. What a completely absurd environment for our typical blithering discourse.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I am hot on the prowl for more clues about this strange and mysterious land!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Ha ha.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Just, ha ha to that.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Anyway, I think I'm getting closer to finding where my house went.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Then I can reunite with dad, and together we can sleuth this great big pickle of a planet!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Well, the good news is your house should be just ahead, if you keep following the trail.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes, I knew it!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The bad news is your dad's not there anymore.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh no!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I guess he got antsy and left to explore. Maybe he's looking for you?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I tried to block him from leaving with some furniture, but the dude was having none of it.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Golly, why did he have to leave??</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: This really complicates matters. I hope he doesn't get lost.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Don't worry, we'll find him. I'll have Seb search within a likely radius. The little guy is real fast.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes. Good idea.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: In the meantime, you'd better go find your house. We aren't making any progress in this game without it. It's kinda central to the gameplay, you know?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: If you need Seb to do anything from afar, just message me, and I'll give him the orders. Got it?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Got it! Thanks!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> ceased pestering <span style="color: #00d5f2">gutsyGumshoe [GG]</span>
