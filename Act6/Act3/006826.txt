<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Well, Jake? Don't you have anything to say?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: ...</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I think I've spent enough time introducing myself! You have hardly said a word.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It would 8e nice to know whether my long story has confounded you in any particular way, or if you are just 8eing shy.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Uh...</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Yes?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Jake, I understand this is very much to learn all at once, 8ut do you really want me to keep speaking until I am 8lue in the face?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: ...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Gulp!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: You appear to 8e perspiring heavily.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: There is no reason to 8e so nervous, especially considering you are only dreaming.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Shit!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Sorry. I dont know where i put the dream towels.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It's ok.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Well, at the risk talking a8out myself a little more, I feel it would 8e dishonest not to confess.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: What?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I am a fairly gifted psychic.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Whoa really?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Like you can see the future?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Are they ghost powers or troll powers? Or wait shucks thats a dumb sounding question.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: No, that was a fine question. They're troll powers. Sometimes those of my 8lood type will have them naturally.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And no, they are not prognosticative a8ilities. They let me access another's mind in a way that can 8e terri8ly invasive if a8used.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Invasive?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Yes. Including the a8ility to control minds, when exploited fully.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Uh oh.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut don't worry. They don't seem to work the same way on your species. They're considera8ly weaker.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The most I can do is get an empathic impression of your emotional state.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: So if I speculate that you are shy or nervous, it is 8ecause I can sense that you are.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Aw man youre kidding!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: So much for trying to be cool i guess.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Although i probably blew that when you saw me yelling at nobody about boners and stuff.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I wouldn't say you 8lew it, 8ut that was certainly odd.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Who were you talking to, if you don't mind my asking?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: That was like...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: The brain ghost memory splinter of my best friend dirk who is stuck in my head and you cant see.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: And he was kinda hassling me and trying to get me to talk to him about how his real self has a thing for me but i kind of think it would be weird to talk to his brain impostor about that? At least for now.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: And then you showed up and you caught me at an awkward moment where he was threatening to make some bodily functions happen in front of you as a joke which would have been embarrassing as all blasted heck.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: But now it turns out you can read my mind too so im surrounded by brain invaders!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: You seem cool aranea but uh when am i going to wake up?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I am not a 8rain invader though!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I said I can only sense your emotions. I think it's polite to let people know 8efore long. Otherwise I 8egin to feel a 8it underhanded.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Ok. I guess thats not too bad.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I think i can keep my feelings buttoned up. That is what strong and adventurous gentlemen do i think. They keep a stiff upper lip even on the inside. That way they are never embarrassed and feel slightly more brave about stuff.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut you don't have to! That was not the point of my telling you.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I'm used to sensing many things from people. There aren't any feelings you could have that would 8e that surprising to me or compromising to you.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I really just want you to relax for the 8rief time we have in this 8u88le and talk to me.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Um gotcha.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: But what should i talk about?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Well, I have spent almost no time examining this iteration of your universe.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The gods have given me very little access to it through the memories of others until now.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I 8elieve they are finally 8eginning to 8ridge the divides 8etween long estranged compartments of reality, allowing previously unintroduced parties to mingle.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Those from different universes, 8oth their initial iterations and their scratched re8oots. Those from different spheres, ones of creative potential and of mortality.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Through us all they attempt to 8ring closure to unsanctioned loops and restore sta8ility to the cosmos.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: So I am curious a8out you and your friends. What is your life like?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: My life?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I wish i could say it was more interesting but its actually been a mite lackluster.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: There are monsters but i try to stay away from them to tell you the truth.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Its mostly just me sitting around here watching movies and stuff and sometimes polishing firearms.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Guns are sweet. So are movies heh. This is a terrible story.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I understand. The same is mostly true for myself.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I can sense that you are either very impressed or in some way intimidated 8y me, 8ut when it comes down to the 8asics, a description of my life would 8e 8oring as well.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Why don't you show me around?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Show you around my room? Yes ok.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Well. There are some guns. Like i said guns are great.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: There is a whole mess of movie posters on the wall. You probably never heard of any of them being a dead alien and such.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Nope. ::::)</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: And...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I dont know. Theres a desk which i use to work on silly projects. And thats my bed i guess. </span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Ummmm and...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Hmm what else.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Dude, just FYI, you've been kind of staring at her.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: (What? Shh!)</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: What was that?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Nothing!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: I'm not trying to fuck you up here, I promise. But you gotta watch what you're thinking, remember?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: (Go away!!)</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Oh man. No. See that thought you just had? That's exactly what I'm talking about.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: She's a fucking empath, bro. She can pick up on shit like that.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: (Shhhhh not listening to you.)</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Jake?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Nothing! Its cool. Im...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: You have got to be kidding. Did you seriously just think something THAT dirty?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: You must be doing this on purpose to spite me now. I mean, just wow dude. That was x-rated as fuck.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: (No no stop. See youre talking about it and now i cant help it!)</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: (You are psyching me into having dirty thoughts get fucking lost you interloping brain douche!!!)</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Don't worry, I'm gone. It's like a goddamn peep show in here and I feel like a sleazy piece of shit watching this from a dark corner of your mind.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: You have a graphic imagination, English. I'm kind of impressed.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: (Shut up theyre just thoughts its not even like im trying to have them THEY DONT MEAN ANYTHING!)</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Hmm.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Should I leave and come 8ack during another dream?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: No!!!</span>
