<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whoa what is THIS place?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Things sure are a rumblin here in this enchanted purple palace.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I cant believe i never found those hidden transport pads under the thing.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Dude, I could have told you they were there.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How did you know about them?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I didn't.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But it's like platformer gaming 101. You look everywhere for secret passages and power-ups and shit.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Elevators are especially fucking suspicious.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You go down an elevator, you wait for the elevator to go back up, you take a peek at what's underneath.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Maybe it's just death spikes. Or maybe you hit warp zone paydirt.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You are so wise. I will never be as elite of a game bro as you.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm not a Game Bro. I just know literally everything about basically all subjects.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Now go back where you came from. Dirk might need help.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Will you untwist your virtual knickers. I have everything under control.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think this may be where my grandma used to go during some of her expeditions.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You dont just pass up the chance for an adventure like this!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yes, Jake. You do.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: How much deeper down the damn bunny hole do you need to go? There is no White Rabbit waiting for you here.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: We will just see about THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Besides i have my skulltop with me so i can swoop in to assist dirk at any time!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: This is an atrocious idea.</span>
