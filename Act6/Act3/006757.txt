<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh theres not much more to it. I had to deal with grandmas body.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I would have loved to give her a proper and dignified memorial like janes granddad got.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: God jane is so lucky every day in her household must be like weekend at bernies! What a riot it must be im so jealous.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, what a fucking treat.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A living room corpse party every goddamn day.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I know right!!!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Alas i had to dispose of the body with haste so the monsters wouldnt eat her.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So i just made a little camp fire and burned it. I keep the ashes deep in the ruins which is where i think she liked it best.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hopefully there isnt an earthquake or something that would knock the urn over in a predictable and hilarious fashion.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No way man.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'd bet my bottom boonbuck that shit's eternally safe.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That urn's like the Fort Knox of standing upright forever because of no accidents.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Heheh yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So then after camping out the next day i went exploring and found my room globe mostly intact sitting in the jungle so thats where i lived since.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And thats pretty much it!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I sure miss my grandma though she was the best.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She was definitely very brave, if the stories are true. Downright audacious, I'd say.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What did you hear?</span>
