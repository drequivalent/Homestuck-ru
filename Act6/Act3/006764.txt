<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: As I mentioned, Crockercorp's rebranding on 3-11, as it was often referred to in the news, totally changed everything.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It marked the beginning of a completely shameless downward spiral of western civilization, through a series of events that were probably hard to notice at the time, but quite glaring when evaluated historically.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Though the Baroness made very few substantive gestures of aggression, the global fear of her looming threat would trigger all the changes she needed.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Governments prepared for war, as if to defend against the invading alien armies she undoubtedly commanded.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But of course, she had no army. She was always the only of her kind.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Instead, the world powers were only setting about to build her armies for her.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The media deteriorated into this preposterous circus that was in all practical ways inseparable from the power base and government institutions.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Popular entertainers became dangerous demagogues, and their roles in the media blurred with those of executive authority.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And the most dangerous were the ones who fed into the fear and hysteria most effectively.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: These tended to be plants. Unscrupulous shills paid by the Baroness to move her agenda forward.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dang.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I would like to think i will not be suckered by their silvery tongues whenever they come along.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well the thing is, most of them are already on the scene in your time.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Who!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ever hear of Guy Fieri?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont think so.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're fortunate then.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He was an especially degenerate piece of filth.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He used his connections and guile to wriggle into the spotlight, and then on to other positions of power.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He somehow landed on the U.S. Supreme Court. Over the years, other justices started mysteriously disappearing without being replaced.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: After helping rewrite the constitution to form an incomprehensible patchwork of fascism, theocratic mandates, recipes, and bad rap lyrics, he weaseled his way up the ranks to become the High Chaplain of Interstellar War.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm just gonna cut to the chase, cause really this ain't a big history lesson here.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He eventually came to be regarded as the third and final Antichrist.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No other human in history was responsible for more death and suffering.</span>
