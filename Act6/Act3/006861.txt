<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Hmm.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Welp, let me have it!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Have what?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: A hard time for botching up the pooch!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I think I just locked the door with that muttonheaded stunt. And now that mirrored obelisk is good as gone.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I wasn't going to say nothin'.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Hell, I was asleep at the wheel too while you were busy fucking up, and I have an IQ of, hold on, robo-calculating...</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Robo-calculating...</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Robo-calculating...</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Robo-calculating...</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh brother.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Robo-calculating...</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: About 500 billion.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That is really, really robo-smart.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Don't get human-fresh with me, Crocker. I'm about to bring all five hundo-billy points of my stringent cyborg IQ to bear on your dumb problem. Check it out.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I took note of the captcha code to the thing, and recorded a digital flashsnap of its appearance through my photographic silicone memory canals.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Which is to say I looked at eight alphanumeric digits a couple minutes ago, and remembered them.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ok?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: So give the bunny the wallet. I'll have him run back to the house and make you a new obelisk with the same grist you just collected from it.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He can stash it in the wallet and run it back to you, and then you can open the door. You shouldn't be waiting around too long, cause he's real spry.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Which is exactly why you should wait here. You'll just slow him down.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Alright, I think I can do that.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What should I do in the meantime?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Let me think about that.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Robo-calculating...</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh stop it!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: K.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: None of our friends will answer me. What could they be up to?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You must at least know what Dirk is doing.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He's slicing up some drones.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Some what?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Big red robots. He'll be busy for a while.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Roxy I'm not sure about, but there is a pretty high probability as governed by the immutable laws of mathematics that she is preoccupied similarly.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: She's fighting robots too, you mean?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I don't know. Maybe.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Dealing with them, in some way, perhaps.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: If so, it wouldn't be a coincidence.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I think the Condesce is attempting to force the issue now.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What? What issue!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It's likely that it's a coordinated assault. Sending drones both to here and Roxy's place.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: She's probably trying to get everyone else to stop dicking around and join the game already.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you sure she's not just trying to kill them?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It wouldn't be her first assassination attempt.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yeah, but come on. Dirk has been a sitting duck here for years. Roxy too.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: She could have wiped them out any time with a swarm much bigger than this one. Or just nuked them.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Her &quot;assassination attempt&quot; on you was pretty weak too.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But it nearly worked!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I would be dead right now if not for the whims of GCat.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Right.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Like I trust the motives of that fucking thing.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So, you're saying she's only pretending to hunt us?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I believe she probably would genuinely like to kill us. She is a psycho after all.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But it's also obvious to me she needs us to begin playing this game, for whatever fucked up purpose she has.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: She might even need us to win it too, for all I know.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Her antagonism is all part of the dance.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Then you're saying Dirk and Roxy aren't really in danger from the robots?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Oh, I wouldn't say that. They're still pretty deadly and they shoot missiles and stuff.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Augh! I just want to talk to my friends and see if they're ok.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What about Jake?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: No idea what's going on with him right now.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm sure when the time is right, the witch will keep pushing him along to join the game as well.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Then I guess I'll just sit here and worry about everyone quietly until Seb gets back.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: What about your troll friend?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The alien whose name you don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You could talk to her.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh yeah!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I forgot about her.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But I suppose that's because she's always the one to contact me. I never get a response when I message her.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Well, you could give her a try. Maybe things are different now.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I could hack into her system to get her attention, if you think that would help.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You can do that??</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Nah, just messin' with you.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Later.</span>
