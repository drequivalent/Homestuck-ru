<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I can't find you anywhere in your crazy house.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It's just wizards and pumpkins as far as the eye can see.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Judging by the sporadic rates of change in your present coordinates, it seems that you have been running around like a lunatic.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: When those ridiculous flesh stilts you refer to as &quot;legs&quot; settle down, and you have a minute to talk, please respond.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: What has taken you so long, anyway? Why has your path been so circuitous?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Surely you can't be even more inebriated than before.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: no no</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: less</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You are accumulating carapacian refugees?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yes</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That seems like a very inefficient and risky use of your time.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i know but</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: they always seem confused and dont know what todo</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Alright, that's fine.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: As luck would have it, your imperfect human sentimentality has been completely factored into my calculations.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You should be ok. Just get back to your house as quickly as possible now. There's no time left.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: lmao @ your &quot;caluculations&quot; as if htose are real but ok ill get moving</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: We're going to need you to connect with Jake to bring him into the game.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You will complete the chain of entry. This is very important.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Don't worry about it for now. Just do your part, and catch up with them later.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Who knows, maybe you will prove yourself to be the only 100% cooperative, fully competent non-Strider player?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: How ironic would it be if the best player turned out to be the drunk girl? Wouldn't that be sweet?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yeah!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: :3</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Go home. Connect with Jake. Deploy the equipment in the ruins of his old house.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'll focus on actually getting him there. The kid is seriously a work in progress, I gotta say.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Are you sober enough to do all that?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i think</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: unfortunately</span>
