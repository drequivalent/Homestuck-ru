<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That's a really nice room there.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But where is she?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hah, her drink is still there. So she can't have gone far.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Oh snap.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I don't see her anywhere in the rest of the house.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I see plenty of plush wizards and window gizmos, and... pumpkins? Really, Roxy?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What an unusual house design. Are all homes in the future like this?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You mean the ones that aren't under water? Yes. They are all almost exactly like that.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I just tried messaging her. But no response.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm sure she's out cruising the hood, probably messin' with the locals.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Maybe attempting some ill advised drunken heroics.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Pretty tight numerical probability of that, I just decided with unfeeling precision.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: She said things were on fire when we last talked?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Actually, she said the whole neighborhood was burning down, if I recall.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But judging by the view from her window, it looks lovely outside.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What exactly is the danger I am saving her from here?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Zoom out.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Way out.</span>
