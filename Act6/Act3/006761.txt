<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No i tried its too depressing. And also uh kind of impossible to understand?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I told roxy i liked it though i didnt want to hurt her feelings so dont say i said that.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think ill wait for the movies to come out i bet ill like those better.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You don't say?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I do say! Hey you mustve seen them what being in the future are they any good?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They are not.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Phooey to that. Like i even believe you!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The books are pretty interesting though, if somewhat dense.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They're supposedly heavily allegorical. Veiled representations of cosmic events surrounding the witch and her boss and how all this came about.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's the kind of thing you wouldn't pick up on unless you were someone who understood what happened, like the Condesce, which was kind of the point. I think it was her way of letting the witch know, &quot;I'm on to you.&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In the early days of the resistance movement they both opposed her more indirectly, through their art, like critics of tyrannical governments often used to.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They had to be careful. Didn't want to make big waves too early.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: My bro did this too with his many fine films.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Practically everything was a symbol for something. Either in mockery of the batterwitch, or conveying some hidden message to its audience. Each film was always rigorously picked apart for its head-scratching symbolic meaning.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But he managed to accomplish all that without ever compromising the purity of his ironic vision, which I think was admirable.</span>
