<span style="color: #929292">UU: i do know a thing or two aboUt the red miles.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is the qUeen's favoUred attack. very long distance and omnidirectional.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt once Upon a time, her weapon was stolen by a UsUrper. jacked, yoU coUld say, right off her ring finger. and then given a considerable boost in power.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that gave the miles enoUgh of a kick to rip a Universe to shreds.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and they have been doing so to yoUrs and its many instances for eons.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: only now have they caUght Up to yoUr instance. it is qUite fortUnate it has taken so long, really.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: some instances are tUcked deeper in the speaker's mighty blow sack, and will hold oUt for mUch longer, on a vast cosmic scale of coUrse.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wait</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i dont</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what? instances</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: blowb sack</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: righ now i can hardly walk w/o steppin on my moms scarf ok</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so theyre destorying the universe is that the bootom line</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: try to think of it like this.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: imagine that the Universe is contained inside a very large creatUre.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: say, a great big frog.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: frog</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why a frog thats so silly</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it's jUst a frog! that is the way it is, jUst try to imagine it.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: k</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: picturin</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: big ol space frog</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: all ribbiting loud an being huge</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hehehe</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now imagine that not only does the Universe exist inside it, depending on the creatUre's health and well being to sUrvive...</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt every potential instance of that Universe exists inside as well.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: those that are doomed and those with promise.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: even those that were reset from scratch, with slightly different starting conditions.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: all of those interrelated Universes mingling together inside yoUr frog, inextricable from its physiology.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if the frog dies, they all go with it. eventUally.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: then you are saying some rude a-hole is killin our frog</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: sadly, yes.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wow</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: that is</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just....</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the WORST</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: well, it coUld have been worse, actUally. the miles coUld have spread to yoUr Universe before it had the chance to sproUt yoUr lovely planet, providing a home for yoU and yoUr wonderfUl mates.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: all Universes die at some point. some sooner than others. it is all part of the cycle, and sometimes things like this mUst happen for reasons beyond oUr Understanding.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt this is neither here nor there. i did not intend to go blathering aboUt all that and waste an important conversation with yoU.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i think the trUth is i am probably jUst stalling.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: stalling what</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i have some important things to tell yoU.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i'm afraid i am going to be breaking so many rUles in doing so.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am not Used to breaking rUles. it makes me very Uncomfortable.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt it may be my only chance. i hope yoU won't think less of me for it.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: no way</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i dont even know what rules ur talking about</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: time shit rules</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt so are yoU, and i've distracted yoU enoUgh.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: concentrate on retUrning to yoUr home.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: once yoU are there and preparing for the game, i will contact yoU again and tell yoU everything that i have been wanting to tell yoU.</span>
