<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Those are amazing stories. I am so lucky to have friends like you.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh snap what about jane! Have you told her?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jane is...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No. I haven't.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I've dropped some hints and tested her willingness to believe something like this.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's just not going to fly. It's way too much drop on somebody all at once if they aren't receptive.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hmm. True but it seems a shame to keep her out of the loop.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, tell her whatever you want. She'll likely think she's being fucked with.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Personally, I wouldn't bother trying too hard to convince her. There's no point in alienating her.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Some day she'll be ready to believe things.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Okay.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wow i still have so many questions.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its incredible that this is all going to happen right around the corner! I dunno if im ready...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like I said, the changes will be a little more gradual than that. More clandestine. She'll exploit the fear caused by her revelation to the world to create intended reactions within governments and media, and her agents embedded on the inside will help nudge things in the direction she wants.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Then, twenty-some years down the road, without anyone suspecting a thing, she'll suddenly be in complete control. And Earth will be fucked.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I want to join the opposition!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Fuck this witch i have lots of guns and reckless bravado and i want to stop her. Ill pick up where my grandma left off!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, aside from the main reasons that won't happen, which I won't get into...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It still wouldn't be a good idea.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Horse shit why not?!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Cause people way better at this than you tried and died?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You said you wanted to hear about our ancestors.</span>
