<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That kid kept the family name but obviously your grandma didn't.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She must've held a grudge against the Baroness her whole life. She started by taking a different name she knew would stick in her craw.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh! I remember this.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I believe she said the witch used to be married to a terrible man named english.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So because the witch really hated that guy she took on his name as sort of a big ole fuck you to the woman?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's probably close to the truth, but it sounds like the kind of story an old lady tells her young grandson in a way he would understand. Or at least wouldn't scare the shit out of him.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What I've read is something much more sinister, as usual.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There's supposedly only one thing the Baroness fears, and your grandma learned of this somehow.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It wasn't an ex husband though. It was her superior. Some kind of demon, or another alien, no one really knows. But he went by the name English. He's supposedly even more brutal than she is, if you can believe that.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So im named after a demon? What kind of demon is named english anyway?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What kind of alien is named Crocker? It's probably just a name he stole from someone else, like the Baroness did.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I guess its kind of cool being named after a demon whos so scary even the witch is afraid of him.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, well, your grandma thought so.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Everything she did in life thereafter seemed to be in effort to piss off the batterwitch.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like starting a competing tech company, heavily branded in a way that was presumably intended to remind the Baroness of her boss.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like with skulls and garish colors and shit. The dude is some kind of skull monster I guess?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I love skulls!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I know.</span>
