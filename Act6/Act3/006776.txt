<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Are you sure you arent real?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No offense but I kind of get the same smartass vibe from you as i do from the responder.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Like har har i have the same basic personality as dirk but without any accountability or anything so let me just be kind of flippant and mess with this jake fellas head!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You know what im saying?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's a surprisingly decent observation about me.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yeah see i think i maybe did a little TOO good of a job brain cloning you? This is way too much like talking to the REAL fake dirk.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Holy cow what a dumb sentence that was.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You did do a good job.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A perfect job, in fact.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Untapped potential, remember?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't think one of Dirk's splinters could exist nearly as well in anyone's mind other than yours.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well thats just spiffy for me but im starting to feel somewhat like im being haunted by you now.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I just want to talk to my real buddy. And by real i just mean the ORIGINAL GUY.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What do you even want to say to him?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh i dont know.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's not like you can keep any secrets from me here.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I pretty much am your brain.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Aaah! No dont say that its so weird.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You do realize he's coming for you.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dirk. In the real world. The man has his designs.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes. I know.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Wanna talk about it?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: With you? No!! Thats like...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Thats like talking to him about it which is like really jumping the gun i think.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What better chance is there to try talking about it than with a stunt double for your hyper-aggressive suitor within the safety and privacy of your own mind?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But i cant yet! I just cant.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: There are some feelings im not sure how to put into words yet and doing it in front of you whether youre a stunt double or brain puppet or whatever it just makes me feel uncomfortable!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So there are feelings you don't want to try to put into words, even while you are dwelling entirely within the realm of your own mind?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What is so hard to understand about that?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What about the spider ghost?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Huh?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The girl you saw.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: When you got fucking clobbered by Dirk's robot and you passed out.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You dreamed about a spider ghost alien girl.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What about her?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You like her.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Man what?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Thats dumb i saw her for three seconds and she waved at me and i woke up!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, and it took all of three seconds for you to fall in love with the cute spider ghost.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why do you keep calling her a ghost??</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Cause she's been dead for a zillion years, dude.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh. Well.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Holy shit?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That won't change the fact that you like her, let's not pretend it will.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're going to make things complicated for yourself.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No i wont.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah you will. You're too fuckin' wishy washy.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Between Dirk, spider ghost, Jane...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Man, poor Jane.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What? What about jane?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You tell me.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What was even the deal with that?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Our last chat ended on very pleasant and amicable terms! She was upbeat and chipper as ever. I fail to see what reason one might have to feel sorry for her.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Uh, yeah. You totally read her like a book.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Really handled that conversation like a champ.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait... didnt i?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Look out bitches. It's Jake &quot;Casanova Ladyslayer&quot; English. He's packing heat, and is frequently able to parse the literal meaning of things women say.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What are you getting at!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We're running out of time.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She'll be here soon.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Jane?!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, doofus.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Spider ghost.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whoa.......</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whoa ok.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Where? Wait. She is??</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh fuck.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Look at you. I'm telling you.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Three damn seconds of ogling an alien in a blue dress, and you're completely hopeless.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Stop fidgeting around like that. Your hair looks fine.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you want me to tell you how your breath smells?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Screw you!!!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I am cool as SUCH a cucumber.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok then.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Uh.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why does my breath not smell ok?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're dreaming, Jake.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Your breath is only a thing if your brain wants it to be.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh okay whew.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: When is she coming? Why is she visiting my dreams?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Soon.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She's been waiting for the right time to enter. Waiting for you to snap out of the memory.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Clearly the girl has the patience of a saint.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Alright...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dang! Its warm in this dream bubble. How can i be sweating in a dream??</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Where do i keep the dream towels...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Will you calm the fuck down?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm a figment of your imagination, and you're still making me nervous.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But really who is she? Whats her deal and what does she want from me?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Since all this so called untapped potential in my subconscious taking the form of yet another sassy dirk clone seems to know everything would it be ok if i troubled my own brain for a few flipping answers???</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You should try to be more polite to me. Seeing as I am a representation of your entire mind, I have complete control over all your basic functions.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I could trigger a particularly spirited bowel movement right before she gets here, so watch your step.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Augh no no no im sorry im sorry dont!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just kidding, dude. Jesus.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I would never make you shit your pants in front of a girl you liked, even if she does happen to be my chief competition.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We Dirk splinters can be pretty Machiavellian but we do actually have some fuckin' standards.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Okay. Thank you for promising to keep my trousers tidy.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Anyway, she's visiting now to bring you into the loop on some things.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Important details you should know about your relation to the bigger picture.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The much, much bigger picture.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I still dont understand how you know... or excuse me MY BRAIN knows this stuff. Because im a page? How does that make sense?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And also if you know the things she will say why dont you just tell me the things?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Intuition and the subconscious mind are powerful things when harnessed the right way.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: As for why I don't tell you, why not just let her tell you?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're the one with the damn crush on her.</span>
