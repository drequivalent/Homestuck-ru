<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Fuck yes the sbahj films RULE.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Screw the haters! Thats what i say.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You also say that about Weekend at Bernies.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Man that is a scandalous mischaracterization. Nobody hates weekend at bernies!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: The WAB films are generally regarded as so unremarkably mediocre they dont even attract any trolls who care enough to shit on it. Believe me ive tried to get in debates with people about it!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, you pretty much touche'd the fuck out of that.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But we are definitely in agreement about my bro's films as the masterstrokes they were.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He just kept cranking them out, too. He really stepped up production after 11/11/11, even though the cat was finally out of the bag. He was very dedicated to his craft.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dang i can hardly wait to see them!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah. I wouldn't hold your breath about that.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why not?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Man, fuck it. I'll just send you them.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: !!!!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just keep a lid on them. We don't need any weird causality shit rearing its head here. That would be dumb.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I will guard each glistening compression artifact with my life, as if a jewel pilfered from a tomb.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which was the last you saw?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well there was sbahj the movovie and sbahj the the film...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh yeah and sbahaj the movle. I think sbahj the moive is still in production right?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But honestly i get confused about which particular misspelling is attributed to which film or even if im getting the misspellings right.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The key to sorting it all out is to understand it doesn't actually matter.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Through video streaming services he would frequently set it up so that buying a certain title would ship you the wrong film.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And often titles for movies were available for sale that just straight up didn't exist. Or would be sold for dollar amounts that made no sense, like $2.890.1. And sometimes buying a download would actually deposit money into your account instead of deducting from it.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It was all part of the &quot;experience.&quot;</span>
