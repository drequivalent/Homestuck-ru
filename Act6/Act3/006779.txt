There are no objects around with which to &quot;pry open window&quot;. 

Look at that. This frame is precisely identical to the previous frame. You advanced nothing whatsoever with that dumb idea.

Do you realize this adventure is nearing 5000 panels? And now we have to watch you flounder around in a jail cell for god knows how long? Exactly how many panels do you want this to go on for? Over 9000? Nobody wants that. Nobody even wants to hear <span style="font-style: italic">the phrase</span> &quot;over 9000.&quot;

You need to begin making better decisions if you want to escape.
