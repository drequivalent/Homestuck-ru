<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's the feeling that it would make perfect sense if a session like this had a dark horse leader.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A leader who was invisible to us all along. Fittingly, a void player to lead a void session.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She would be a leader not in name or in spirit or in function, whatever that means.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But more of an emotional leader, who would selflessly try to hold everyone together while the rest of us did our best to fall apart.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And Roxy has been that for us every step of the way, going unnoticed and unappreciated.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Think of how much shit she's had to put up with from all of us.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She never complains, never turns it around and makes it about her problems.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She just works her ass off making sure we all stay friends.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If that isn't a leader, I don't know what is.</span>
