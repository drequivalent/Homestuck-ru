<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dude!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Where you at, man.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Wait.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which computer are you using?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm not comfortable knowing my words could be hovering over Cage's clownish, sort of gaunt face.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Could you maybe switch back to naked blue chicks as your exclusive desktop fodder? TIA.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't know if you just want a little solitude.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or if maybe you finally just got like,</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A case of Strider fatigue.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I could understand that.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I mean, not to get all neurotic on you.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm just saying I get it, if that's what's going on.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But for real, if you gotta sneak away for a few days, that's cool.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just might be kind of dope if you at least would let me know which planet you scurried off to.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And by dope I guess I mean considerate?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Really not trying to be a drag here.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Wondering what's up is all.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Want to meet up soon?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I found a really promising tomb we could raid.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Looks like it runs hella deep.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If I've got the specs right, could run as deep as the Lion's Mouth itself.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But without all the fuckin' fire to deal with.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Wait, I mean <span style="text-decoration: underline">Lion's Mouth</span>.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Gotta underline that key shit. Always forget.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Figure it should take a couple days to make it to the bottom.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Only a day if we both go limp and just fall the whole way down the stairs.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ignoring literally every sage warning we've ever received about those treacherous plummetation zigzags.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just tumbling on down in a floppy limbed trance like a couple of puppets in a race arranged by some drunk gamblers.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If you're into another expedition, head to LOTAK and hit me up. Just don't forget your mask this time.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The deeper we go, the worse it gets, remember?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Could be some unreal grist down there.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: More puzzle shit.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Loads of skeletons.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Pack your guns dog.</span>
