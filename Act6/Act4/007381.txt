<span style="color: #323232">FUCK IT.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">I'LL JUST TYPE IN ALL BIG LETTERS. EVEN THE U'S. WHO CARES.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Aw, looks like someone just took his first big step toward growing up!</span>
<span style="color: #323232">ACTUALLY, TYPING THIS WAY IS A LOT EASIER. LOOKS LIKE I WIN THIS ROUND ASSHOLE.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Win what? I was the one advocating the use of caps lock in the first place, doofus.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">DON'T ANTAGONIZE ME. YOU AREN'T A FUNNY PERSON.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">I CAN TELL YOU THINK YOU'RE FUNNY. I MAY HAVE PROBLEMS LEARNING.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">BUT I KNOW WHEN A PIECE OF GARBAGE IS TRYING TO BE FUNNY. UNSUCCESSFULLY.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You're right. I do think I'm funny sometimes. Maybe I'm wrong though.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">HAHA! YOU ARE. JUST A WRONG AND UNFUNNY GUY.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">We all have our flaws to overcome. I do my best, just like you.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Think of all you've done in spite of your learning problems. You don't let your disability hold you back, do you?</span>
<span style="color: #323232">I GUESS.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You won that game of chess with that stupid gambit. Switching the hats, remember? It was a lame ploy, and totally not in the spirit of the rules, but it got under her skin enough to force a loss anyway.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You also hired Jack to murder your sister. Which was a dick move, but reasonably clever.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">YES.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">THOSE THINGS I DID WERE GREAT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Well, they weren't great so much as terrible. But the point is you can accomplish anything if you put your mind to it.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Just because you struggle with learning doesn't mean you can't realize your destiny. You just have to work a little harder at it.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">And if you're dealt a lousy hand - and you definitely were with this shitty solo session - then you have to work even harder.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I know you will.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You are going to prove all the haters wrong, exceed your own limitations by miles, and accomplish more than you ever dreamed possible.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Yours is quite an inspiring story, actually. It's just a shame that all of your accomplishments will be so horrible.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">But that's really beside the point.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">YEAH, I ALREADY KNEW I WAS INCREDIBLE AND SPECIAL.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO. INSPIRE ME. SAVE YOUR BREATH FUCKHEAD.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">No, I don't give a shit about making you feel better about yourself.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I'm not your guardian or your sprite or your exile or your fucking life coach. I'm just saying some things that are true through the narrative prompt.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Take the facts or leave them!</span>
<span style="color: #323232">MOST OF YOUR FACTS ARE BORING SO FAR.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">I WOULD LIKE BETTER AND MORE USEFUL FACTS. RIGHT NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You may be destined for bigger things, but you're still an atrocious, stupid child.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">And you may have won the &quot;game&quot; with your sister, but that doesn't mean it was the best thing for your development as a person.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You had her dream self killed, which is not an opportunity your species typically gets. So she died prematurely, instead of allowing the conflict within you to settle itself naturally.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">In short, you forced your predomination to happen a little too early, and now you're stuck.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">STUCK?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Yes. Your personality is stuck in some sort of cantankerous prepubescent limbo. You are going to be a stunted, miserable tool forever.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">WELL, HOW LONG WAS I EVEN SUPPOSED TO WAIT. FOR THAT TWEE BITCH TO GET OUT OF MY SKULL.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">It's kind of sad. You don't really know anything about your own species, do you?</span>
<span style="color: #323232">AND I GUESS YOU DO?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Uh, yeah?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Pretty much everything.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">TELL ME THEN.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">No.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">GOD. DAMN IT.</span>
