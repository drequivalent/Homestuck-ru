<span style="color: #000000">Now all the monitors have power.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Each one is set to a different channel. But they won't display anything unless they're unlocked.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You unlock them by finding the right keys and using them on that little model of the radio tower next to you.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">One of them is unlocked for you already. Can you see it up there?</span>
<span style="color: #323232">YES. YES! I CAN SEE IT.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">IT IS A VIEW OF MY DEAD SISTER. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">SHE REALLY MAKES. A MORE BREATHTAKING CORPSE. THAN I EVER IMAGINED.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Whatever you say, weirdo.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Anyway, it's like I said. This is a glorified computer. If you want to change your text color, you can sample some pixels from the display.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">THIS IS PERFECT.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">I WAS INTENDING ON USING HER PUTRID GREEN BLOOD. TO COLOR MY TEXT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Were you?</span>
<span style="color: #323232">YES. IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE. PAINTING MY WORDS IN HER BLOOD. AS A TOKEN OF MY RUTHLESS TRIUMPH.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">THEN ON THE NEXT TIME I WAS GOING TO HARASS SOMEBODY. IT WAS GOING TO BE ALL LIKE. LOOK WHO WON. IT'S JUST ME NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">AND I WOULD JUST BE LIKE. NOW WHAT'S UP. *BITCHES*.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">IT WAS GOING TO BE.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">SOOOO.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">*BAAAAAADASSSS*.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Ok.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">ALSO. THIS IS A FUNNY COINCIDENCE. BUT I WAS ALSO BATTING AROUND THE IDEA.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">OF STEALING HER BIG U'S ANYWAY?</span>
<span style="color: #323232">I MEAN. AS ANOTHER KIND OF TROPHY. TO LET PEOPLE KNOW. I'M WHOLE. AND THE BEST SIBLING IS IN CHARGE NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">I WAS ON THE FENCE ABOUT DOING THAT THOUGH. BUT I GUESS YOUR STUPID LOCKED KEYBOARD. MAYBE FORCED THE ISSUE.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">BUT I'LL JUST SAY BADASSERY WAS THE REASON. AND OMIT THE TEDIOUS ANECDOTE ABOUT THE KEYBOARD.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">SO YEAH.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Then let's consider this a serendipitous facilitation of all your most juvenile typing fantasies.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Let nobody henceforth mistake you for a guy who isn't trying as hard as he can to type like a cold blooded motherfucker.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">YES. THAT'S WHAT I WANT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Great. Now grab that mouse there and pick a new color.</span>
