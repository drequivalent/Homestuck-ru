<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Never mind.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait dont tell me.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Is it a tomb or a crypt or somesuch? Are you preparing for another grist seeking expedition??</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh shit did you schedule my assistance for the raid and i forgot all about it???</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: No, Jake.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: We didn't need your help raiding a tomb. But thanks for thinking of us.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I don't know what this clueless pair of damsels would do without you.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Blast.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well what in the name of willy howard tafts great tub choking bottom could i be forgetting then?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: This is going to drive me CRAZY! Can you give me a hint?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes. It has to do with the day I was born, which was almost exactly sixteen years ago.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Of course! Your birthday!!!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Didn't you get Roxy's invitation?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It was my understanding that she gave you and Dirk notice weeks ago.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes thats right. Now i remember. The date sure snuck up on us quick didnt it?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sorry you know how things can slip my mind. The gourd on my shoulders isnt the steel trap it used to be. Nothing like the well oiled puzzlebuster you've got up there.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Mm.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well damn.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Looks like the egg monster took quite the spirited dump on my face this time.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jake. I... what?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I feel so dumb. Ill be right over.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Well, if you recall, the party is actually tomorrow.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Like I said, we're just setting a few things up.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Roxy is putting up some decorations. I baked a cake. You were of course free to join us early too. I just thought since I hadn't heard from you in quite some time, you had better things to do.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You baked a cake for your own party?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes. So?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont know something seems amiss about that. Isnt that against tradition or inviting bad luck or something?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But I guess it makes sense since you love baking cakes. Its like a present you give to yourself!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jake, what was it you actually wanted?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh. I just wanted to get your advice on some stuff.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But since ive been a heel and forgotten about your party maybe i shouldnt bother you with that?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Mmm.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So sixteen big ones huh! The ole sweet sixteen.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Last one of us to notch the vaunted one sixer. Its a big step! I knew youd make it, i always said i believed in you didnt i?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Just kidding, the inexorable nature of times passage virtually assured you would get that old so you didnt really have anything to do with it. I mean not that i dont still believe in you, i do.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: ...</span>
