<span style="color: #929292">UU: on the day he foUnd a way to kill my dream self, i was done for. thoUgh to be honest, i doUbt i'd have fared mUch better regardless.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i think his half was always meant to predominate.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: my will was simply not strong enoUgh to overcome his. yoU know as well as i how stUbborn he is. i don't think he has ever had even a smidgen of doUbt in his thoUghts, or remorse for his deeds. whereas i was always plagUed by sUch feelings.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: on some level i always knew he woUld win. bUt i fooled myself. i thoUght i coUld overcome his ego by looking beyond his negative qUalities, staying optimistic, and working together with him in a game to accomplish something extraordinary.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and that in doing so, perhaps i coUld begin to help him change. to teach him to evolve beyond his hatefUl natUre. and as he changed for the better, slowly but sUrely, he woUld become more like myself.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that was how i thoUght i coUld predominate. it was how i was going to win! and really, if he grew closer to me in that way, by learning kindness and compassion, we both woUld have won. my predomination woUld not have meant his absolUte death, but oUr trUe Union.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt sadly, i Underestimated how consUmed he was with the need to destroy me.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now he is completely obsessed with finding my soUl and wiping me oUt for good, even if it means tearing apart the reality that sUrroUnds Us.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he will never feel he has won Until all traces of me are gone.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: uuuugh</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hearing all that just makes me so unreasonably mad</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: FUCK that shitlord</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i feel so bad knowing you died and there wasnt anything i could do</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: no matter how much i said your name :(</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: don't fret. yoU did all yoU coUld.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: isnt there some way we could bring you back</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: some baller fuckin magic, or a bomb ass faeryspell</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i mean could we find an answer in like, for instance</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: YE ENCHANTMENTES?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: very Unlikely.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: dangit</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok then</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: if i cant do that</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: then i guess the next best thing would be</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: to find your lil shit of a bro and feed him a steady diet of his own ass</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ^u^</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: that is what we are supposed to do right</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i mean</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: from what i gather</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the dude is ridicubad news</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just such brutal and stinky news</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so eventually somebodys got to kill him</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and that is probly us aint it?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it's trUe that he deserves a comeUppance like few others.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt slaying him is not actUally yoUr responsibility as heroes now.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: in fact, if anyone mUst bear that bUrden, it might be me.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: oh yeh?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: possibly.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as we speak, there are hUndreds of soUls oUt here in the fUrthest ring working to defeat him.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: some search for a fabled treasUre. a weapon said to spell his certain demise.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: while others say that i myself am this weapon. :U</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and so they search for me.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: they band together in great nUmbers for this caUse, and attract his devastation in hopes of revealing the path to the weapon.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: while at the same time, they draw his attention away from me. and it is a good thing that they do.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i mUst remain hidden from everyone for as long as i can.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why not come out and be all like</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: here i am yo its me! secret weapon ghost callie ;)</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: becaUse i am no sUch thing!</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i was already Useless against my brother when he was jUst a brat who liked to tease me.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now that he is an exceptionally mUscUlar and invincible adUlt, my chances are laUghable.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: no, if i am to contribUte, i need more time.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i mUst go in search of my own weapon.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what weapon?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ironically, the same weapon which many of them are looking for.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: me!</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ??</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it's the only sliver of hope i have.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i have reason to sUspect there may be another iteration of myself oUt here.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: one from a doomed timeline, who has kept hidden for a long time, jUst like i have.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt Unlike me, she sUpposedly came from a reality where she predominated instead of my brother.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and not by the means which i described. hers was not a mild Union of reconciliation.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: amazingly, her predomination was absolUte! a major feat of will, jUst as his was with me.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as sUch, she went on to play the game, and...</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: well, i cannot even imagine what followed, aside from the fact that she eventUally mUst have died for existing in an offshoot reality.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if she exists, i woUld be eager to meet her. it woUld be a chance to get to know a version of myself who was strong enoUgh to override the will of my brother.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: someone i might have become if i had a little more coUrage. u_u</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and if she is sUch a person, then i really believe all i have heard mUst be trUe. i believe she is the key to defeating him.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so i have no choice.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i mUst go in search of myself.</span>
