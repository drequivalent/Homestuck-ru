<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: that u</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes, it is i!</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: holy shit</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the most pious and reverential of shits</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: turd in a church callie</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you startled me!</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: sorry! :u</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but yeah so</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hey!!!</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: nice 2 finally meet you</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wow wee ur pretty</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so when you said you werent good looking it turns out that was a bunch of baloney?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: no, roxy. i am afraid it was not a helping of yoUr delicioUs earth baloney.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: aw dont say that</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: also you said you were a cherub</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but if i am not mistaken you appear to be a troll</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: unless cherubs actually look like trolls?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: alas, we do not.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: this is not my trUe appearance. i have taken the form of my trollsona.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i wanted to look more presentable for oUr meetUp. UnfortUnately my trUe visage woUld likely repUlse or frighten yoU.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that is not the first impression i woUld like to make.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: girl please</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: trust me theres nothing you could look like that would make me scared of you or grossed out</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i am your friend and i know youre nice inside no matter what, so</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: could i see the real u?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that is so kind of yoU to say. i can believe that a lovely person like yoU woUld be able to stop herself from recoiling at the sight of my monstroUs face.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt it is oUt of the qUestion. i am mUch more comfortable appearing to yoU this way.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: really it has more to do with my own dissatisfaction with the way i look than any lack of trUst in yoUr character.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU Understand, don't yoU?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yes</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its ok callie you can go on keep being a cute troll</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: im just happy to see you</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: likewise!</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i wish it coUld be Under better circUmstances thoUgh.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: we may not have mUch time here.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wheres here exactly</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: am i still dreamin?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes. i have led yoU to a dream bUbble of my own design.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: my imagination and thoUghts dictate what yoU see here.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as i told yoU earlier, my brother is hUnting for me. so i have created a little sanctUary in space to stay hidden from him.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that is why i coUld not speak to yoU earlier. not oUt loUd at least. he is highly sensitive to my presence, so it is very easy for me to get his attention if i'm not carefUl.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt as long as we stand in the centre of this vortex, we may speak as loUdly as we like! no information can escape this dark pocket, so long as i maintain it.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and seeing as yoU are a hero of void, yoU make an ideal gUest to bring home for one who wishes to remain hidden. thoUgh i will say the fact that yoU are my best friend is a lovely bonUs. ^u^</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: best bonus!!!</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: 4 real though its so nice to finally see you no matter what you make urself look like</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ive wanted to tell you all about whats been going on with me and my friends since we got together</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its been so fun hangin with them even in spite of lets be frank, some truly SELECT teen drama</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: mmmm see how im kissin my two pinched fingers here? mwah it was like that</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the embarrassing teenanigans have been SUMPTUOUS and come highly recommended</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: no but really its been great, and after some time irl with them it started feelin weird to think we were ever even apart</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yet sadly it was not complete because the moment i met them all was also the moment i totally lost touch with my other cool bffsy from THE WEBS</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i tried calling and calling your name but you never answered</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i know.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am sorry. u_u</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: dont be sorry i knew youda answered if you could have</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i guess maybe you hid yourself so deep in this dream i couldnt wake ya?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: damn this must have sucked spending all this time here hiding from your asshole brother</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like i know hes a dick i talked to him enough times to get that but</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: whys he tryin to kill u so bad?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he is not trying to kill me.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he has already sUcceeded at that.</span>
