<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh goody. Just the way i like my hijinks!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So how do we start.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THERE'S NOT MUCH TO THIS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I JUST TELL YOU SOME SHIT TO DO. AND THEN YOU DO IT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: AND THE ULTIMATE DUMBNESS OF IT ALL IS. YOU PROBABLY WERE GOING TO DO A LOT OF IT ANYWAY.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I was?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How was i going to do the stuff if you didnt tell me to?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You mean i was going to do it like on accident?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: NO. THE THING IS. I THINK WAS ALWAYS GOING TO TELL YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont understand.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: NEITHER DO I.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ok then.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im glad we settled that.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BUT I KIND OF GET IT ON SOME LEVEL.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: AS A LORD OF TIME. I THINK I'M GOING TO MASTER TIME. NOT WITH MY BRAIN. WHICH WOULD BE TOO HARD. BUT WITH MY INSTINCTS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: LIKE IN A WAY THAT WORKS WITH MY NATURAL IMPULSES. SUCH AS MY AMBITION. MY WILL TO COMMIT MAYHEM. MY DESIRE TO PUNISH THOSE I DESPISE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: SO IF I WANT YOU TO BECOME STRONG. SO YOU CAN CHALLENGE ME LATER. AND I SEE EVIDENCE. THAT YOU PROBABLY BECOME SUCCESSFUL.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I THINK TO MYSELF. WHY SHOULDN'T I BE THE ONE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN? IF IT'S GOING TO ANYWAY.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I THINK PART OF MY PERSONAL QUEST. IS TO BECOME AT EASE WITH THE FORCES OF INEVITABILITY.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: INEVITABILITY THAT ALL THINGS SHOULD AND WILL FALL IN MY FAVOR. THAT ALL CAUSALITY ANSWERS TO ME. AND THAT ALL OUTCOMES NOT ONLY SERVE ME. BUT CONSIST OF MY BEING.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: SO I FEEL THAT. THE MORE I GROW IN POWER.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THE MORE STUFF IT SHOULD TURN OUT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: UP TO AND INCLUDING. EVERYTHING THAT EVER HAPPENS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: EVEN IF IT HAS TO BE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: RETROACTIVELY.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hmmmmm...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Nope!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dont reckon i understand much of that either.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But i guess im not supposed to. Me not being a time maestro or what have you.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I guess i should be boning up on hope though. What can you tell me about that?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I DON'T KNOW A FUCKING THING ABOUT HOPE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A FORCE OF &quot;UNPARALLELED POWER&quot;. BUT REALLY. IT SOUNDS SO LAME.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHY IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT'S YOUR ASPECT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: YOU STRIKE ME AS A GUY WHO IS LAME ENOUGH. TO HOPE SOMEONE TO DEATH. SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL *ME* ABOUT IT??</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Tell you about hope?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Um well its something i think everyone should have in their hearts.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I KNEW IT. YOU JUST SAID.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THE LAMEST POSSIBLE THING.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But i wasnt finished!</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: FUCK.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hope to me is all about believing in stuff.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: If you believe in stuff then everything feels like its going to turn out ok.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And if you believe in stuff with enough gusto i dare say it imbues that stuff with a pinch more chutzpah. Even the fake stuff!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And then if you keep an open mind and adventurous spirit, that chutzpah flows directly into your heart, and thats when YOU have the power.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So i think if hope grants one the power to smite villainy and vanquish hooligans thats probably where it comes from!</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: NO.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: OH GOD. NO.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THAT IS ACTUALLY THE WORST THING I'VE EVER READ.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT. I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well THERES your problem dude. You dont want to BELIEVE!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Just let go and believe in things. Then youll find you had the power in you all along.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: YOU ARE SO DUMB. I JUST KEEP CAN'T BELIEVING IT. HOW TRULY STUPID YOU ARE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: WHATEVER. FORGET I ASKED.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND OUT WHAT HOPE IS REALLY ABOUT. INSTEAD OF THAT INSIPID BULLSHIT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: ONCE YOU BECOME A GOD TIER.</span>
