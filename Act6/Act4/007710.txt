<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: SUCH a gay dude</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and i guess maybe hitting on a guy who dont like girls once or twice maybe is alright or even flattering but after so long it was probably just pissing him off or messing with his head or something</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: it def wasnt what he wanted to hear from a friend</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: let alone day in and day out through garbled drunktexts</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: it just brought back some low rent shit i thought we put behind us</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just another way i completely humiliated myself in front of him</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So is that why you cant talk to him now?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: mmmmmmmm hmmmmmmm</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I certainly have no trouble relating to that.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yep</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i dont even know why really</span>
