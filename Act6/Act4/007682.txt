<span style="color: #2ed73a">I THINK I'VE BEEN FORCED TO UNLOCK THESE SCREENS. AND VIEW THESE POINTLESS EVENTS. LONG ENOUGH.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">MY QUEST IS DUMB. I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO GET ON WITH THE REAL ADVENTURE.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Has it occurred to you that your quest in its limitless tedium and thankless busywork was designed to facilitate your personal growth?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">To prepare you for your ultimate destiny beyond this game?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">ANYWAY DIDN'T YOU SAY ONE TIME. I WAS INCAPABLE OF GROWING???</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Oh right.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Well, has it occurred to you that it might have been designed to fuck with your head and serve as a punishment for being such a horrible little shit?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YES!!!</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YES.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THAT OCCURS TO ME. EVERY SECOND I THINK ABOUT IT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I HAVE TOLERATED MANY AGGRAVATIONS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">AND AM PREPARED TO TOLERATE MANY MORE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IF IT GETS ME CLOSER TO TRIUMPHING OVER YOU AND THIS MORONIC GAME.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WILL FIND MORE KEYS UNDER RANDOM ASS UNLABELED STONES.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WILL WATCH ANOTHER MILLION HOURS OF NUMBSKULLS WHIMPERING ABOUT THEIR ROMANCE NOT COMING TRUE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WILL EVEN ENDURE MORE OF THESE PATENTLY LUDICROUS ACT ACT ACT ACT ACT ACTS EVEN THOUGH THEY APPEAR TO MEAN NOTHING AT ALL.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BUT WHAT I WILL NOT STAND FOR.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IS GOING.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FUCKING.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BACKWARDS!!!</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Fair enough.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">But I already told you how to accelerate your viewing.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT? WHEN.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">See those two panes of glass there?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Take your crowbar and smash them.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OH. YEAH.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">UGH. I FORGOT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY WAY. TO GO TO WHAT'S NEXT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO THAT I CAN PUT MY PLANS IN MOTION?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You should be pleased by the irony.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Smashing the glass will cause you to reflect upon a lifetime you have yet to spend...</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Um.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Breaking stuff.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">???</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Is the irony not fucking delicious?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">STOP TRYING TO BOGART MY SCHTICK. OF PLAYING INSIDIOUS MIND GAMES AND DOING SHITTY TWISTS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YOU SUCK AT IT SO BAD.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I'm sorry.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IT'S NOT BREAKING THE GLASS I MIND.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THIS IS THE THING THAT INVOLVES.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">*SHUDDER*</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">&quot;TEAM WORK&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">RIGHT?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You and a buddy have to turn both keys simultaneously.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">It will teach you a wonderful lesson about life.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FUCK!</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Don't act like you aren't secretly having a great time there with your new friends.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You are practically the ringmaster of your own little dark carnival by now.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">And you're loving every minute of it. Don't deny it.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO I'M NOT!</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Sooner or later you will have to face the fact that literally all adventures are about learning the value of teamwork.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Teamwork and friendship. The two razor sharp edges of the mighty excalibur which EVERY hero should keep in his scabbard.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Even shitty heroes like you.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FINE. I'LL DO IT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BUT ONLY BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE. WHERE I TALK TO YOU. FOR EVEN ONE MORE SECOND.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WOULD BE SO MUCH WORSE.</span>
