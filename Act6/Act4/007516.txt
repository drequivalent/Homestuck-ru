<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you sound like a real popular lady out here</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: even you are looking for you!</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: indeed.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: well i hope you can find her</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: if thats your job</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: to find bizarro calliope and go wollop ur bro</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: then what is our heroic biz?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it's the same as it always was.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: to win the game.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: oh yeah</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: duh</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is as i once told jane.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: with victory yoU may finally exit this vast whirling storm.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: by claiming yoUr reward yoU woUld bring closUre to a very wide coil of caUsality, one not tracing a continUoUs path like a snake, bUt intricately woven like a wreath.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a ring of coUntless little rises and falls, ascents and descents, on its way Up and down a pair of mUch bigger ones itself.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: from alpha to beta, then beta to alpha, as if a moUntain to be scaled and then climbed back down. its peak toUches the eye of a storm which cannot end Until the moment yoU all walk throUgh that door.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: only then will there be calm.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ._.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ah, bUgger. forgive me, sometimes i forget myself and begin speaking in riddles.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it's jUst a habit that is in the natUre of my people.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yeah i know</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: at least yours r better than your bros stupid games</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: don't remind me. in my opinion they do not qUalify as anything of the sort, mUch the same as his &quot;shitty twists&quot;. &gt;:u</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so then from what im surmising here is we dont need to beat him to win our game</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like dealing with him directly is kinda out of our domain?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as the one who provoked the breach in paradox space which i jUst coloUrfUlly described, he has always exerted his inflUence on yoUr realities from afar, and from many different angles. throUgh Unwitting sUrrogates, oUtsoUrced manipUlation, oUtright enslavement, and even petty harassment. bUt most of all, he prevails throUgh the simple inertia of inevitability that has always been on his side, as a lord of time.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and as the one who is to blame for foolishly allowing him access to sUch power, it's only proper that i take responsibility for finding a way to defeat him.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt even thoUgh his methods of inflUencing yoUr session are indirect, they are still formidable.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: there will be a nUmber of powerfUl foes who stand between yoU and victory.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: tomorrow, a terrific battle will take place.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: when yoU wake Up, i sUggest yoU begin to prepare.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ummmm ok</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: how</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like make more sick gear</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i could hustle up another batch of illwicked guns</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just a big ol pile of guns</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: jake can have the wimpy smaller ones</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: make jane like a fancy new fork or spoon or such</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like an elite endgame spoon</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: whatever that is</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like uh</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the chowderfucker 5000</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: janey be flippin her godspoon round bopping monsters doing like</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: CUCKOO damage</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wont bother make nothin 4 dirk since hes basically married to his boring anime sword</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like u could even pry that thing from his rad dead cadaver</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes, i'm sUre new eqUipment woUld come in handy.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now that yoU mention it, well before i died or even realized i woUld not live to play, i made special exception to my rUle of staying linear with conversation. i messaged jane a birthday gift.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU see, i had a brief vision from skaia which sUggested to me she coUld Use a boost in morale on this special day, so i offered her something very dear to me. jUst a little token to show appreciation for her friendship.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i hope it will cheer her Up, and moreover that it will prove at least somewhat UsefUl to yoUr party.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt really, at this stage if yoU wish to prevail against sUch stacked odds, collecting boons sUch as new weapons and treasUres will only go so far.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i think yoU will need to embrace a far more sUbstantive gambit.</span>
