<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: See, to be perfectly honest, we are a party of losers.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Heroes make shit happen. But that's not what we do, or what we're even SUPPOSED to do.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We wait.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We wait for literally everything. We wait for other people to reach out first so we can fix our relationships. We wait for these legendary heroes to arrive and bring competence and promise to a futile situation.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Even now. Look at us. What are we waiting for?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: To kill ourselves? For someone to come along and do it for us?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It doesn't even matter.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: As the four nobles of the void session, we do what we were created to do.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We sit around on our asses.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Waiting.</span>
