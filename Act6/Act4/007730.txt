<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We were all designated for a session that was utterly inert.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A place where the mechanisms for success never even existed to begin with.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In such a place it makes sense that the formal leader would be neutralized, to made feel unempowered and static.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And it seems particularly fitting she would be the noble of life in a realm of the dead.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A realm that foretold of a life player who felt lifeless, a hope player who felt hopeless, and a heart player who was just a stone cold motherfucker.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: When we talked about leadership, and I was all on my high horse telling you how shit would go down...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I also said I would be the one &quot;pulling the strings.&quot; Remember? That I'd be the functional leader of our party.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And there might have been something to that, in a different session.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But what good is a &quot;man of action&quot; in a place where action itself is intrinsically fruitless?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So it's occurred to me that by some tragic flaw in its design, our session was meant to be leaderless.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And I'd feel safe concluding that. Except for a feeling that's been gnawing at me.</span>
