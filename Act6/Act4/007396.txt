<span style="color: #000000">Thank you.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Now what exactly would you like to know?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">EVERYTHING.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Everything is a lot.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Care to narrow it down a little?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OBVIOUSLY NOT THE BORING IRRELEVANT THINGS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">DEFINITELY NOT THINGS LIKE. WHO KISSES PEOPLE. WITH THEIR UNPLEASANT NONSKELETAL SMOOSHY LIPS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">JUST ALL THE THINGS THAT I NEED TO KNOW TO WIN THIS GAME.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">That's not how adventures work though.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You don't just make some omniscient narrator inside a computer tell you everything all at once.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">There's like this whole process to it. You reveal certain things at the right time, depending on whether the hero has met certain requirements and is ready to learn those things.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">What you learn and what I tell you is more up to you than it is to me.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHO CARES.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I DON'T WANT YOUR EXCUSES.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Aren't you excited about your adventure? About being unchained for the first time ever, and getting to explore this mysterious place, and meeting people and solving puzzles that will lead to the realization of who you were meant to be, and how you fit into this epic?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO FAR. THE ADVENTURE IS BORING, AND FRUSTRATING, AND CONSISTS OF AN IDIOT IN A COMPUTER, AND A CLOWN WHO WON'T DIE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WANT TO KNOW WHEN I GET TO START FUCKING SHIT UP.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You'll definitely get to do that later.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHEN.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Not long from now.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LIKE. IN A COUPLE HOURS. OR.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">That's up to you. There are puzzles to solve all over your planet. Your mentor can help.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">The sooner you do that, the sooner the fun will begin.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YOU REALLY AREN'T TELLING ME ANYTHING.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WE HAD A DEAL. I PUT THE CROWBAR DOWN. NOW TELL ME THINGS.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Why don't we narrow the scope of the Q&amp;A then?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Try asking very specific questions, and I'll decide if it would be appropriate to answer at this time.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YEAH. GOOD IDEA.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THEN MY FIRST QUESTION IS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT IS THE PLACE.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">The Medium. You are in your game session.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I KNOW THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT'S THIS PLANET, I MEAN.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">It was called Earth.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">EARTH. THAT'S IT?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Weren't all the Statues of Liberty a dead giveaway?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">If you see one or more shitty old Statues of Liberty on any post-apocalyptic wasteland planet, that automatically means it was Earth all along, as a rule.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Then when you realize that, you're supposed to have a mental breakdown.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I AM UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS RULE. AND SKEPTICAL OF IT'S VERACITY.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">TELL ME MORE ABOUT EARTH.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">It's the place humans are from. But that was a very long time ago, with respect to the planet's current age.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Earth has been through a lot. It was even relocated a couple times.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YES. I BROUGHT IT WITH ME, I THINK.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">INTO THE GAME.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Yes. But it was relocated once even before that.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">It was moved from its native solar system, where it circled around a little yellow sun.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Then it founds its way to a new system, around your big red sun. It stayed there for a good while, until your sun started dying.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY WOULD SOMEONE MOVE A PLANET.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Its universe was about to explode. So its proprietor closed up shop and got it the hell out of there.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">HOW.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">That's not important for you to know. Suffice to say, planets just have a way of scooting around in this adventure.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OK. WHY IS THIS MY PLANET IN THE GAME THOUGH.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Cause your kernelsprite turned into a black hole and sucked it into your session?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO I MEAN. I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A COOL AND SPECIAL PLACE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LIKE A LAND OF SOMETHING AND SOMETHING.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You do.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You just have to unlock it.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">That is when your real quest will begin.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">HOW DO I DO THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You know. Finding keys. Solving problems.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">All the potential for extraordinary achievements in your quest must be unlocked first.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">We've been over this.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHERE DO I FIND THE KEYS.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LIES.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Why would I know that? You think I'm like an encyclopedia on key locations??</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I got better things to think about than where all your stupid keys are.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Find them yourself. Better hop to it!</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO. MORE QUESTIONS FIRST.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT AM I ULTIMATELY STRIVING TO UNLOCK.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">TO MAKE MY REAL LAND APPEAR.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IS IT SOME SORT OF GIANT, FANCY KEYHOLE.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">No. More like a big door.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">A DOOR TO WHAT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">TREASURE?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Kind of.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">If there's any treasure in there, it would be guarded by your denizen.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT'S THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">A powerful monster that rules your planet, asleep in the core.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">He appeared there the moment Earth got sucked into your session.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT KIND OF MONSTER.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IS IT A DEADLY, CHALLENGING MONSTER?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">He is the deadliest, most challenging denizen of all.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">He very rarely appears in game sessions, and is usually designated for the most naturally gifted warriors.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">His name is Yaldabaoth.</span>
