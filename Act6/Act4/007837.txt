<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what do you actually want from her</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: do you want her to stop drinking faygo and falling asleep in puddles of red fructose corn slobber</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: or do you want her to somehow address the root of those habits and cut all that out for good</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: yeah i can understand where youre coming from</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but in situations like this i think you need to remind yourself theres only so much you can do for somebody</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and maybe they arent going to want or need your help and you just have to figure out how to deal with that</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like at some point in your life one of your friends might start spending all her time with a guy you think is bad news</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and you have to decide if you need to intervene as a friend or just let it go because people can change or drift apart or whatever because thats just something that happens</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: DAVE</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: look all im saying is</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: there comes a time in every young womans life when she has to come to terms with the decision to gradually morph into a juggalo while all her friends and loved ones watch in dismay</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: terezi has strolled through the dark carnival and taken a great brooding whiff of that decisions festive asshole and the choice she has made is all too clear</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: i thought this was supposed to be like this &quot;big secret&quot; that would &quot;destroy you&quot; if you found out</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: MOTHERFUCKER, PLEASE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: DO YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT? I'VE SUSPECTED THIS WAS GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: BUT THE REALITY IS IT WAS JUST ONE DAY, AND HE'D BE WELL WITHIN A REASONABLE FRAME OF MIND NOT TO GIVE A CRAP IN HINDSIGHT ABOUT THE GUY WHO TROLLED HIM ONCE THREE YEARS AGO.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: yeah the mayor rules</span>
