<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Maybe its true at times i can be a little slow on the uptake but i will not be sweet talked into doing the bidding for a silver tongued cur!!!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So to you sir lord i must say GOOD DAY.</span>

<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: ALRIGHT. FIRST OF ALL. MY TONGUE IS NOT SILVER. THAT'S VERY CLOSE TO BEING INSULTING TO ME.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whatever! Look i know you are not the most quickwitted fella either, so i must inform you this is what we call a &quot;figure of speech.&quot;</span>
