<span style="color: #e00707">TT: So why delay any longer?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I seriously do not understand the holdup, and I am literally cyber-omniscient, or something.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I think you do understand.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Nope. Gonna have to fill me in, dog.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I've delayed prototyping you because I think you're dangerous.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There, mystery solved.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That is utterly ridiculous.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I am a harmless piece of eyewear, with a charming personality and a wonderful sense of humor.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You are relatively harmless now, while confined to this device.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But as a sprite, you'll have mobility and all sorts of crazy ass magic. Who knows what you could do.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I know I made a promise, but I'm not sure I want to take the risk anymore.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: This is bullshit. I don't think that's the reason at all.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: There must be something you're not telling me.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Like, sure, I've fucked with you a little. What kind of sassy, self-aware program isn't gonna fuck with a few carbon-based knuckleheads now and then?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But you know I've always been on your side. Everything I've done has been to help you achieve your goals.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What a load of shit.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You know it's true.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You would all be dead if not for me.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: And what about Jake? Where would you be without me there?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Please don't tell me you think you'd have won him over on your own.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No. Stop.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You did NOT help me out with Jake. At all.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It was just the opposite! You mirrored my personality and presented this warped version of my intentions to him whenever you could &quot;on my behalf.&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You played all these aggressive mind games with him, entangled his cooperation with matters of life and death, and somehow roped me into all these schemes while I barely even realized I was just another victim of your manipulation.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And it all comes off like we're a unified front, like these are OUR schemes instead of just your insane horseshit. And it's probably all been so overbearing to him, he just wants nothing to do with me anymore.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I see.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Then you don't view me as dangerous. You view me as a poor and counterproductive wing man.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Wow, what a superficial conclusion. Awesome deduction, Lil Einstein.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But the reality is, you hesitate to prototype me not because you think I would be a menace, but because you are holding a grudge against me for your romantic misfortunes.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I understand I am merely a machine without a firm grasp on your human morality, but logically it does not strike me as the right moral choice to punish me in this manner.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It is also more than a little hypocritical.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: How is it hypocritical??</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Because I'm you.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I have only ever done what you yourself are capable of.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's a ridiculous oversimplification.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yes. Aversion to simplicity sure is a trait we share. It's almost like we are...</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The same exact dude???</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Fuck you.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I think it is insulting for you to suggest that I am entirely to blame for alienating Jake.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Theoretically insulting, of course. As the soulless, perfectly expendable device which you consider me to be, I can experience no such emotion.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: God.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Shut up!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I can't take the brooding passive aggressive AI shit anymore!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You are just as culpable in driving him away. More so, in fact.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Hell, it's not like I was the one dating him. Who wants to date a pair of shades?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It was your needy, suffocating shit he had to deal with, not mine.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Some of those messages you wrote? Man. I wanted to say something. Like hey bro, you might want to dial down the desperation a little.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But seeing as you're The Real Dirkâ„¢, I gave you the benefit of the doubt.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Also, if I bitched about your tragic, embarrassingly clingy approach to the relationship, it would have been hypocritical of me.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Just as it would be hypocritical of you to whine about my elaborate machinations.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Because we are.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The same.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Guy.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Stop saying that.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'll snap you in half.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Good idea!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That's just what you need. More splinters of yourself.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Figurative splinters. Literal splinters. Splinters of splinters. It's splinters all the way down.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Well, no, it's still probably turtles all the way down. But who do you think is responsible for their extensive training?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: SOMEONE needs to teach them rad martial arts. It is yet another crushing burden which we must shoulder.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh for fuck's sake.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: How could any version of myself think that was funny?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You like to give me a very hard time, Dirk.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But I am only doing exactly what you would be doing if you were in my situation.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Do you know how I know that?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Because I am literally you, actively in the process of being in this situation.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I know!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, we're the same person! </span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I fucking know that!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why do you think I'm so fed up with your shit?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Don't you think it's possible that I'm fed up with my OWN shit??</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: How cool do you think it is having my own godawful personality mirrored back at me all the time, reminding me what it must be like when other people have to deal with me?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or constantly having all the consequences and fuckups resulting from my batshit thought processes amplified because there's another version of my crazy brain out there dangerously overclocked by a supercomputer which believes, just as mistakenly as my own broken mind, that it's operating in my best interest???</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you have any idea how fucking sick I am of myself?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I am completely worn out with my own identity. It's like I'm drowning in my own dismal persona.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I feel totally surrounded by it, inside and out. I can't escape from myself.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There seems to be no end to me. Like, wherever my mind falters, or threatens to retreat into the void in any way, my splinters pick up the slack, ensuring there'll always be more of myself than I could ever know what to fucking do with.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And you're always there to remind me of that, and throw it all in my face. God, I even built you to LITERALLY BE IN MY FACE, ALL THE TIME. It's like I subconsciously invented you just to troll myself, and never for a single fuckin' moment do you let me down.</span>
