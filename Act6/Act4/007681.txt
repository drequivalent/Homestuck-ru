<span style="color: #2ed73a">FINE. NOW WHAT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Caliborn, first let me explain something to you. </span>
<span style="color: #000000">I guess it falls on me to teach you these life lessons, because as unpleasant as the idea is for both of us, I am the closest thing you will ever have to a father.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You see, teenagers are sensitive and beautiful creatures.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Well, not you. You are repulsive. But most teenagers, I mean.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You can't just force them to settle all their issues with insane psychotropic game powerups.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">They have to face all those issues themselves, or they will never learn and grow as people.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHO CARES??</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Well, you don't. But human beings do.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">The journey itself is more important than the destination.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">The struggle is what builds character and teaches us about ourselves and about life.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BULLSHIT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I DID THEM ALL A FAVOR. BY GIVING THEM MY JUJU.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THEY WERE GOING NOWHERE. AND BEING STUPID.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">AND DOING LITERALLY NOTHING WHATSOEVER. EXCEPT FOR WALLOWING IN GROTESQUE EMOTIONS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LOOK HOW MUCH GREAT STUFF THEY GOT DONE BECAUSE OF ME!</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Of course you think you were doing them a favor. You're an alien.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">So is your sister. She thought the juju would be a great boon for them as well. But she was wrong.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">See, you cherubs are predisposed to love all this trickster crap. All that goofy squeaky candy coated nonsense is a critical part of your people's mythos.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">That sugarized zillyjunk sort of embodies a unified field of absurd Platonic ideals to the cherubim, so when you see expressions of it in reality of course you're gonna go apeshit.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">But that kind of stuff is freakish and disturbing to humans. Those aren't our ideals.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Furthermore, that could only be seen as a boon from an asocial species.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You never have to deal with other people. So if you lick a magic lollipop that flips a switch in your brain that says &quot;all my problems are solved,&quot; I guess maybe that's fine for cherubs, but if you're a human you haven't actually solved anything.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">By the same logic it's not much of a boon to a human's physical journey either.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Using an item that lets them start maniacally powering from point A to point B isn't doing them any favors.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">It's like when Mario gets the star.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You know when Mario gets the star?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHO THE FUCK IS MARIO.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">He's a small Italian plumber who goes on sideways adventures.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">He jumps on stuff and bops bricks with his head to save a princess.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT'S ITALIAN.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT'S A PLUMBER.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Never mind what an Italian is. It's just a kind of guy on Earth.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">And a plumber is a guy who fixes load gapers.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT'S A LOAD GAPER.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Shut up.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Anyway, sometimes when Mario's running sideways he gets a star that makes him magic and invincible.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OH. YOU MEAN HE BECOMES TRICKSTER MARIO.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Yes, but less stupid.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">So for a while he becomes flashy and hyperactive and nothing's challenging anymore.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">He just starts barreling over mushrooms and leaping over pits as fast as he can, then gets to the end and jumps on the flagpole and that's it. Mario &quot;wins&quot;.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">But the point is, he didn't really win. That magic star was actually devastating to his development as a human being.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Because he skipped over many critical trials on his spiritual journey.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Mario NEEDS to stomp on all those mushrooms. He NEEDS to bonk those bricks with his head, for the sake of his personal growth.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">By using the star, he is denying himself many powerful moments of catharsis.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">UH.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Well, I don't know. Maybe Mario isn't the best example.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Like I'm not sure if Mario really even has a soul?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">He's just kind of a one-dimensional friendly cartoon plumber.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">So maybe this stuff doesn't quite apply to him.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">But these aren't one-dimensional plumbers we're talking about here.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">These are TEENS.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">And as we all know, teens have BIG FEELINGS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE OF THIS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THE DISCOURSE WITH YOU HAS BEEN EVEN MORE GRATING AND UNPALATABLE THAN USUAL.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YOU SAID YOU'D HELP ME SPEED UP MY QUEST. BUT ALL YOU DID.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WAS TRICK ME INTO HEARING ANOTHER CONVERSATION. IN WHICH YOU INDULGE YOURSELF TO AN EXTENT. WHICH I CANNOT EVEN BELIEVE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I'M GOING TO HIT THINGS WITH MY CROWBAR AGAIN.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">No don't!</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Jane is still nursing a wicked hangover you ass.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THEN BE USEFUL TO ME.</span>
