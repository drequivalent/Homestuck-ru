<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: How long do you think it's been a problem?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i dont know its hard to say exactly when i started getting real carried away</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just at some point i discovered a load of my moms centurys old booze in the house</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and i didnt have much to relate to her by except her books</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so i felt like drinking was a way to be more like her</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: or be closer to her kinda</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and there was nobody around except the silly chess people</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: who in a way just made me feel more alone</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: cause they reminded me i was only one of two humans left and the other was an ocean away</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so little by little</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i got out of hand</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and one of the only things i had to look forward to was the idea that the game was supposed to be able to bring my mom back</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: assuming i even decided to help the batterwitch out by playing at all</span>
