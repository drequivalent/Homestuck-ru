<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Rox?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wat</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Am i an asshole?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: no j</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think i might be an asshole.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: All of my friends hate me now.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Are you sure im not just an asshole and never actually realized it?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: well maybe youre an asshole sometimes but its always on accident and most people are accidental assholes a lot of times anyway so who cares</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I cant believe i was so oblivious to the feelings of all the people i care about.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How could i not see that jane was in love with me? I really am a dope.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I guess i did know deep down at some point... but then i somehow convinced myself otherwise?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I cant even imagine how she must have felt all this time i was seeing dirk. And all those times i talked her ear off about our relationship! Oh goodness.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yuuup</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I wonder what things would be like if she told me?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Maybe its better she didnt in the end.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I probably would have just broken her heart like i did with dirk.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I should say something to her but im not sure what to say. I dont think she wants to hear anything from me to be honest.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Maybe you could tell her im sorry for me?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why cant you just tell her</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: shes right there</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dunno. Shes obviously so mad at me. I cant bring myself to say anything.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im also just really fucking chagrined over how i treated her.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: If i was brave i could face that feeling and just talk to her and try to make us square.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But i dont think i really am brave.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im not brave and i dont think i love adventure either.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wow... jake...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You know how you think you know these things about yourself?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Like all these personal attributes about you as if theyre written down somewhere like a sort of mini biography so they have to be true.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So you just believe them and hope that the believing is what makes them true.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But then you spend so much time believing those things and taking their truth for granted that you somehow forget to MAKE them true with your words and deeds.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How can i truly love adventure when i never even knew what it was?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont think its raiding tombs and clobbering scoundrels.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: That stuffs fun and all but thats not what adventure is.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Adventure is...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its something else.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its doing the things im genuinely afraid to do.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But cant.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Because im a coward.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok ok stop shittin on urself ill tell her for you</span>
