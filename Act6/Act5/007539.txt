<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She has?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: God damn it. Have you been intercepting my messages again with your bullshit responder?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I thought it would be better not to let anything disrupt our train of thought.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: We were in the middle of a fairly solid feelings jam there. In fact, I was about to suggest we take it to the hat pile.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Hat pile? What?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dude, please don't screen my calls, ok?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I was trying to be considerate.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Or at least as close an approximation to that human gesture as an unfeeling, technologically transcendental pair of sunnies can replicate.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you have any idea how old your ironic AI schtick has gotten?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nobody is buying it. We all know you have legit emotions. Incomprehensible, fucked up computer emotions, but emotions nonetheless.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And I'm not really offended by you answering messages for me, so much as your use of that STUPID responder responder.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's really passive aggressive.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: How so?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: First of all, everyone knows you have the processing power to answer any message any time in parallel with whatever you're doing. You can never actually be &quot;busy.&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Second, your whole next gen responder thing is obviously just a huge dig at me.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And third, pretending you don't understand all this already is really disingenuous.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: At the risk of compounding my disingenuous behavior, I'm gonna have to ask: how is it a dig at you?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's obviously a critique of my personality. You barely disguise the fact that you see me as the inferior iteration.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Wow. You are reading way too much into this.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Lil Hal Junior hardly even qualifies as a computer program, let alone a sentient entity.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He is capable of saying literally only three things. &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;Hmm,&quot; and &quot;Interesting.&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, that's the fucking point!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's how you chose to express your parody of &quot;Real Dirk.&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You can read whatever you like into it. I can't imagine it would bother you if you weren't concerned there might be some truth in the alleged parody.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: In any case, my use of the responder responder is ironic.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's not ironic.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: YOU were ironic when I made you.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Then you became self-aware, and ruined irony forever.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Irony can never be ruined. We both proved that theorem unequivocally with our extensive papers on the subject.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: We peer reviewed them for each other. Remember?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Those papers were ironic, and you know it.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Were they, Dirk?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Were they?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This is fuckin' dumb.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Anyway, what does she want.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Who?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Roxy.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Nothing that can't wait.</span>
