<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/JANETHISISYOU" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://tinyurl.com/JANETHISISYOU</a></span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Groan.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I BELIEVE I HAVE CHOSEN THE PERFECT SHAPE FOR YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: IT IS DESCRIBED IN CERTAIN CIRCLES KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE ARTS. AS. &quot;A CIRCLE&quot;.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I AM VERY PLEASED WITH HOW FAITHFULLY IT HAS CAPTURED THE OBSCENE ROTUNDITY. OF YOUR MAGNIFICENT CARRIAGE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: TRULY A SPITTING IMAGE OF THE CROCKER BITCH.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY. YOU MAY LEARN SOMETHING.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THE MASTERPIECE AFICIONADO WILL NOTICE. HOW I ACHIEVED THIS HIGHLY ADVANCED AND DIFFICULT SHAPE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: WHAT MOST GIFTED ARTISANS WILL TELL YOU. IS THAT. CIRCLES ARE BASICALLY FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: TRUST ME.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: IT'S LIKE A PARADOX. A SHAPE WITHOUT ANGLES. WHAT??</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: SO I FUCKING CHEATED.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I NAVIGATED THE IRRATIONAL PERIMETER BY MAKING A LOT OF EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE, TOTALLY LOGICAL MARKS. FORMING A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE RIGHT ANGLES.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THE CHEATING PART HAPPENS WHEN I DO THIS A LOT. SO IT GOES IN A ROUND DIRECTION.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THIS ONE CAME OUT WELL I THINK. BUT THERE'S ROOM TO IMPROVE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I HAVE THEORIZED THAT IF I KEEP MAKING BOGUS CIRCLES LIKE THIS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: WHILE DRAWING MORE AND MORE ANGLES. BUT SMALLER. SO SMALL THAT YOU START CAN'T SEEING THEM.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THAT THE ILLUSION OF THE CIRCLE WILL BE COMPLETE! AND PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE IN THE FAKE CIRCLE. LIKE A BUNCH OF SUCKERS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I BET NOBODY HAS THOUGHT OF THAT CIRCLE STRATEGY. I THINK I'M THE FIRST AT THIS IDEA. AND BEST AT IT ALREADY.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: PEOPLE THINK I'M DUMB. ESPECIALLY THE VOICE IN MY HEAD.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: AND THEY MAY BE RIGHT ABOUT ME BEING DUMB.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPECIAL WAY I DO THINGS. WHICH IS ALWAYS ACTUALLY. THE PERFECT WAY.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I AM.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: A GENIUS!</span>
