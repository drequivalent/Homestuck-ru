<span style="color: #005682">AG: That's ok. There is plenty of time to sort it all out.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I've 8een keeping an eye on you all for quite a while. Your whole planet, actually. It was very interesting this time around, to say the least.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It even had a different name! &quot;Alternia.&quot; Haha. How heavy handed can you get?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: The man responsi8le was a 8it of a wise guy. He rewrote everything. He had a knack for overzealous storytelling, which is a harmless enough ha8it usually. I'm guilty of it myself sometimes.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut it is not so harmless when the perpetrator is omniscient and omnipotent.</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: OMN1SC13NT?</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: YOU M34N</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: MR M1LKSH4K3???</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: That's right.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut he's dead now, and his story is over. The 8ook on our universe is closed, 8oth for my instance and yours.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: This 8eing the case, I thought it was the right time to introduce myself. The com8ined work of my group and yours is unfinished, and the outcome has not 8een assured.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: The true ultimate reward has yet to 8e achieved. No safe haven has 8een created that is free from the devastation caused 8y Mr. Milkshake's grand deception.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Our race still teeters on extinction. The mem8ers of your party, and one noteworthy fugitive, are the sole survivors.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: We must work together to create that haven and restore our race, so that the sacrifices we all made will not 8e in vain.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut in order to repair the unthinka8le damage that has 8een done, we need to allow ourselves the chance to heal first.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Old wounds, old regrets. They will serve no purpose on the rest of your journey.</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: R3GR3TS</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: 4R3 YOU T4LK1NG 4BOUT M3 4ND VR1SK4?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Sure. You have to start somewhere.</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: DO YOU KNOW WH3R3 SH3 1S?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Not at the moment.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut the more time you spend here, the more likely it is you will find whomever you are looking for.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: On the other hand, if it is the unknowa8le will of the gods, you may dance around each other indefinitely as you pass through this space. It is hard to say.</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: OH</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: OK TH3N</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: 1M NOT SUR3 WH3TH3R TO B3 R3L13V3D OR FRUSTR4T3D BY TH4T</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Well, if she had 8een dwelling in this 8u88le like you thought, what would you want to say to her?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Surely you would not have just argued a8out the past.</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: NO</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: 1 ST1LL DONT KNOW WH4T 1 WOULD S4Y TO H3R</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Then what would you say to me?</span>
