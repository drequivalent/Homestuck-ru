<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Yes, we will have to deal with Jack before all is said and done.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: And that will definitely be a major challenge.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: But it is not impossible. At least, not by design.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: When I said there would be no time limit in this session, I was talking about something more specific.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: There will be no reckoning.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: oh</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: why not</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It's a logical consequence of any void session.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: The battlefield never evolves, and therefore the more extensive war between Prospit and Derse never takes shape.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It is only when the Prospitian king falls in battle that the reckoning can be initiated by the forces of Derse.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: The meteors then rush to destroy the battlefield, while Skaia redirects them through defense portals for as long as it can.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Thus, if there is no war, there is no reckoning, no meteors, and no imminent threat of failure.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: This is of course good news for Earth as well. During the reckoning, Skaia redirects all incoming meteors to the only place it can. Earth.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: So it turns out that players who initiate a void session are not actually condemning their home planet to an apocalyptic wasteland after they leave.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: In the new instance of our universe, Earth is just fine.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Sort of.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: so</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: no meteors came at all</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: you mean by fucking up and having to scratch we also sort of saved earth in the process</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Again: sort of.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: And it's not that there were no meteors whatsoever.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Just the vast majority of the destructive onslaught never showed up.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: But delivering the temple to the site of the forge is still integral to jumpstarting the session.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: That meteor however could have been propelled through a portal by any means, not just via the reckoning.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: i see</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what about the players themselves</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: they had to arrive on meteors too didnt they</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: i guess the baby meteors were some exceptions too right</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: But they weren't flung through portals in their own session, nor will they be created there.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: They were created in our session, and sent back through our portals. Just like us.</span>
