<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I KNOW WHY.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: YOU DO?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YEAH.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: WELL OF COURSE YOU DO.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: I GUESS BECAUSE I JUST TOLD YOU TEN MINUTES AGO, MAKING IT LIKE A SELF-FULFILLING EPIPHANY??</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WELL THERE'S THAT</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BUT ALSO THIS CONVERSATION HELPED CLARIFY SOME THOUGHTS TOO, IN SPITE OF ITS EXCRUCIATING POINTLESSNESS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: PART OF WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU ABOUT THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS ABOUT MORTALITY.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: YEAH</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: AFTER VISITING WHO KNOWS HOW MANY DREAM BUBBLES</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: AND HANGING OUT WITH WHO KNOWS HOW MANY DEAD FRIENDS, AND *COPIES* OF DEAD FRIENDS FROM ALTERNATE TIMELINES...</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: I START TO WONDER, DOES DEATH EVEN REALLY MEAN ANYTHING?</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: DID LIFE MEAN ANYTHING, FOR THAT MATTER??</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: WAS THE POINT OF LIFE TO JUST GO AROUND COLLECTING A BUNCH OF PAINFUL AND AWKWARD EXPERIENCES TO SUPPLY MATERIAL FOR THE REVOLVING MEMORY-COLLAGE THAT SERVES AS THE BACKDROP TO A MUCH LONGER, EMPTIER STRETCH OF EXISTENCE?</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: AND HOW UNNERVING IS IT RUNNING INTO OUR DEAD DOPPELGANGERS FROM DOOMED TIMELINES?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HEY, YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR, BRO.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: IT'S FUCKED UP.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: NEVER MIND WHAT IT MEANS ABOUT A PERSON'S IDENTITY OR SENSE OF SELF, OR WHICH GUY GETS TO BE CONSIDERED &quot;THE REAL GUY&quot; OR PHILOSOPHICAL BULLSHIT LIKE THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: JUST ON THE LEVEL OF WHAT YOUR DECISIONS AND ACTIONS DURING YOUR LIFE ACTUALLY MEAN.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: SOMETIMES WE RUN INTO THESE VERSIONS OF OURSELVES WHO REACHED GOD TIER FOR FUCK'S SAKE.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: BUT IN SPITE OF BEING *MORE* SUCCESSFUL THAN WE WERE, BY THAT PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE MEASURE</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: THEY GET PUNISHED FOR THAT, BECAUSE IT WASN'T &quot;THE THING THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN&quot;??</span>
