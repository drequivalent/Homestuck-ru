<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: im not reading that shit</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: i cant even read your stupid troll language why would you think i can</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: I THINK YOU SHOULD RECONSIDER. I CAN TRANSLATE FOR YOU. I'LL READ THE WHOLE DAMN THING ALOUD IF YOU WANT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: SERIOUSLY, IT COULD REALLY EXPAND YOUR LIMITED HUMAN THINK PAN ON STUFF.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: THERE'S A LOT HERE THAT'S APPLICABLE TO OUR SITUATION.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: there is nothing even slightly applicable about any of that bullshit to our situation</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: DON'T BE DENSE. OF COURSE THERE IS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: TEREZI AND I HAVE BEEN ON THE VERGE OF VACILLATING LIKE THIS FOR A LONG TIME.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: IT'S ABOUT TIME WE KILLED THE SUSPENSE AND JUST ACKNOWLEDGED IT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: YOU AND SHE SEEM BENT ON DEVELOPING SOMETHING IN THE FLUSHED QUADRANT, AND LIKE I SAID, I'M FINE WITH THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: IF WE CAN JUST GET OUR SHIT STRAIGHTENED OUT, WE CAN BE LIKE THESE VACILLATING PAIRS THAT ALTERNATE BETWEEN RED AND BLACK, BUT IN A WAY THAT'S COMPLEMENTARY WITH EACH OTHER'S PATTERNS.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: oh my god</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: why is this happening</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: LIKE WHILE SHE AND I ARE BLACK, YOU AND SHE ARE RED.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: BUT THEN WHEN SHE AND I ARE RED, YOU AND SHE... I DON'T KNOW IF HUMANS ARE REALLY CAPABLE OF BLACK FEELINGS?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: I GUESS THAT'S UP TO YOU. MAYBE YOU CAN JUST LIKE, SIT THOSE PERIODS OUT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: LIKE TAKE A BREAK, YOU KNOW?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: youve completely lost it dude</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: i cant believe for a fucking second this is reasonable shit to propose even on troll world</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: you just</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: totally snapped</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: SNAPPED LIKE A FUCKING FOX. THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: LIKE I SAID, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF RESPONSIBLE SCHEDULING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: HERE LET ME SHOW YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: I NEED SOME PAPER. WHERE'S SOME PAPER.</span>
