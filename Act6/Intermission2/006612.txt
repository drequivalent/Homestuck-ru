<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: oh no</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what the hot mess of fresh fuck am i looking at</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: IT'S AN ALTERNIAN ROMANCE NOVEL.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: NOW LOOK, I'M NOT VOUCHING FOR THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LITERATURE. IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY TRASHY AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED I COULD RECOMMEND MUCH BETTER THINGS TO YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: IT'S JUST THIS ONE ILLUSTRATES THE CONCEPT VERY CLEARLY.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what...</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: &quot;concept&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: IT'S A PRETTY TYPICAL CASE OF QUADRANT VACILLATION AS APPLIED TO AN OVERLAPPING GROUP OF ROMANTIC PAIRINGS.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: you lost me at quadrant</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: for future reference thats the word that always lets me know its time to check out of a sentence</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: WILL YOU PIPE DOWN AND JUST HEAR ME OUT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: IT'S REALLY SIMPLE. THINK OF IT AS BEING SIMILAR TO ONE OF YOUR PRIMITIVE HUMAN LOVE TRIANGLES.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: THOUGH THIS IS A QUADRANGLE. THOSE ARE MUCH MORE COMMON IN OUR SOCIETY AND ENTERTAINMENT, AND FOUR IS PRETTY MUCH THE MINIMUM VALUE FOR LOVE-HATE N-DRANGLES.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: n drangles</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: god dammit</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: NOW HERE IS WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON WITH THIS GROUP OF CHARACTERS. PAY ATTENTION. HEY, LOOK AT ME. EYES OVER HERE. GOOD.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: SEE THE TWO HEROES IN THE MIDDLE, PARTAKING IN THEIR FLUSHED EMBRACE? PRETTY MUCH YOUR TYPICAL LOWBLOOD REDROM PAIRING. THEIR DYNAMIC IS THE GRUBLOAF AND TUBER PASTE OF THE OVERALL ARC.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: .........</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: BUT WHAT HAVE WE HERE? THERE ARE SOME NEFARIOUS HIGHBLOODS IN THE PICTURE TOO. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: THE GUY ON THE LEFT IS AN OLD CALIGINOUS FLAME FROM THE MALE LOWBLOOD'S PAST, AND HAS REENTERED THE PICTURE. AGAIN, NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. HE CAN CONTINUE TO COURT HIS MATESPRIT AND KISMESIS WITHOUT CONFLICT. IT'S A PERFECTLY AMICABLE ARRANGEMENT THAT EVERYONE'S TOTALLY DOWN WITH.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what is that huge beefcake troll even doing</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: is he grinding against the little dudes shoulder what is even going on</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: why the fuck is he nude</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: NO QUESTIONS YET.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: SO THEN THAT'S ALL FINE, PRETTY BOILERPLATE CONDITIONS FOR UNFOLDING ROMDRAMA, BUT THERE'S A TWIST.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: THE MALE HIGHBLOOD AND LOWBLOOD START TO HAVE FLUSHED FEELINGS FOR ONE ANOTHER, AND THIS RESULTS IN SOME RED INFIDELITY BETWEEN THE LOWBLOOD PAIR.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: OBVIOUSLY THIS IS WHERE THE FIREWORKS START GOING OFF. THE RED FEELINGS BETWEEN THE LOWBLOODS TURN TO BLACK, AND THUS BEGINS WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS QUADRANT VACILLATION.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: MEANWHILE THE TWO MALES ARE ALSO VACILLATING BETWEEN RED AND BLACK, BECAUSE YOU DON'T JUST LET GO OF A RIVALRY SO EASILY.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what is going on with the other chick</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: all grabbing at the other one down there in the corner</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: YEAH, WELL, IT GETS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT, PROBABLY MORE THAN NEEDED FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING THE POINT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: IN THE HEAT OF THEIR VACILLATION, DURING AN ESPECIALLY BLACK PHASE, THE LOWBLOOD FEMALE WAXES RED FOR A NOTORIOUS AND ESPECIALLY BRUTAL HIGHBLOOD FEMALE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: SO THEY HAVE THEIR THING ON THE SIDE, BUT EVEN THAT STARTS VACILLATING TOO BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL PAIR JUST KEEP SPINNING LIKE A TOP.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: WE DON'T NEED TO GET BOGGED DOWN IN THE QUADRANGLE DYNAMIC THOUGH, AND FOR OUR PURPOSES THE 4TH PARTY IS A DISTRACTION.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: our purposes</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what the fuck are our purposes</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: THE THING IS, VACILLATION ALWAYS ADDS A LOT OF DRAMA TO EVERYTHING, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T BE VIABLE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: IT CAN TOTALLY WORK, AND EVERYONE CAN BE REASONABLE ABOUT IT, IT REALLY JUST COMES DOWN TO A MATTER OF SENSIBLE SCHEDULING.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: you must be out of your fucking mind if you think i want to know where youre going with this</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: DAVE, PLEASE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: JUST READ THE BOOK, OK? IT'S ALL IN THE BOOK.</span>
