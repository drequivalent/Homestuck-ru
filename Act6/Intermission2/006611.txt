<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: OK, LOOK I'M NOWHERE NEAR YOUR PRECIOUS STUPID CAPE. JUST LISTEN.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: BEFORE YOU GO OFF TO SNOG TEREZI IN YOUR IDIOTIC LITTLE VILLAGE OF NUTRITION CYLINDERS, HEAR ME OUT.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: man</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: you are so overblowing this</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: so weve done a few things together to pass the time so what</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: i dont even think you could call them dates or anything</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what the fuck would even qualify as a date on this gross dark meteor</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: DAVE, CAN WE JUST CUT THE SHIT?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: I AM NOT AN IMBECILE. YOU ARE BOTH PLAINLY TIPPING INTO FLUSHED TERRITORY IRRESPECTIVE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS OR WHATEVER LAME CONDITIONS IT IS HUMANS BELIEVE TO BE OPTIMAL FOR PURSUING A MATESPRITSHIP.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: ANYONE CAN SEE THAT, IT'S THE SHITTIEST KEPT SECRET ON THIS METEOR. PROBABLY EVEN THE FUCKING MAYOR GETS IT, AND LET'S FACE IT, HE'S A LITTLE SLOW.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU COULD PULL THE WOOLBEAST MATERIAL OVER THE EYES OF A HARDENED VETERAN OF ROMANTIC STUDIES?</span>

<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: I HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF TROLL ROMANCE FILMS, EACH DEALING WITH TOPICS FAR MORE SUBTLE AND COMPLEX THAN YOUR PEDESTRIAN HUMAN MIND COULD EVER GRASP.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: AND IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN, I'VE ALREADY WATCHED HUNDREDS OF YOUR MORE PRIMITIVE BUT MODERATELY ENTERTAINING ROMANCE FILMS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: REMEMBER HOW I DOWNLOADED A FUCK TON OF THEM AFTER DISCOVERING YOUR SPECIES? I AM A CURIOUS MAN, DAVE, YOU COULD LEARN FROM ME.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: yeah i remember</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: havent you only watched a bunch of shitty dane cook movies on infinite loop since we left</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: YOU'RE SEVERELY EXAGGERATING, BUT YES I HAVE SAMPLED HIS WORK.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: dude</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: you know youre only pretending to be a huge fan of his bullshit to piss me off</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: AGAIN LOOK AT HOW SELF ABSORBED YOU'RE BEING!!!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: I HAPPEN TO THINK HE HAS A BRILLIANT COMEDIC MIND, FOR A HUMAN.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: hrnngngnngghhhh</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: it turns out that exact sentence is my one weakness</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: you win bro you got your girl back</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: OH SHUT UP.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: I AM NOT HERE TO DEBATE YOU ON THE FINER POINTS OF CINEMA, OR TO &quot;GET MY GIRL BACK.&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: HOW DESPERATE DO YOU THINK I AM?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO DO THE OPPOSITE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: I WANTED TO TELL YOU I'M TOTALLY OK WITH.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: oh</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: ok then</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: BUT JUST LISTEN, AND TRY TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND. I KNOW THAT'S HARD FOR YOU.</span>
