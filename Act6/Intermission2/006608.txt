<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: lets not even talk about it ok</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: can we slow down this meteor</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: delay the meetup</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: maybe fight jack for a little while</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: I honestly thought you would find the idea exciting.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: I know I'm looking forward to it.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but your mom was just a nice alcoholic spinster who liked wizards who you complained about for no reason</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: she wasnt anything like an untouchable master of irony who could replace the meat in your sandwich before it even occurred to you what the fuck you were chewing</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: let me ask you this did your mom ever wiggle a puppet in your face even ONCE</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Not that I recall.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: But anecdotes like that just make me more curious to meet him, personally.</span>
