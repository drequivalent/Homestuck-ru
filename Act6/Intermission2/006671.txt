<span style="color: #005682">AG: No. I can empathize.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: She was a serious trou8lemaker in your party. Many player groups have to deal with those.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I feel as though we had one of the worst cases in our party. 8ut when all was said and done, she was still our friend.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: At that moment, perhaps.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You know very well the channels of possi8ility at that exact juncture resulted from her decision paths as well as yours.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut even so, when it comes to your key decisions, the possi8ilities are pro8a8ly fewer and more discrete than you have presumed.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Otherwise you would not see results consolidated into those vortices, would you? Possi8ility would resem8le an enormous hazy field of infinitely su8tle variations and micro-choices.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Imagine if at that moment you truly were capa8le of anything, no matter how outlandish, a8surd, or patently fruitless. How would this vast amount of information present itself to you through your senses? What difference would it make in your final decision if all other tri8utaries of whim spilled into the same decaying future? And what would this make of your agency as a hero meant to learn and grow?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Look at it this way. Imagine that over the course of someone's life, they are truly capa8le of every conceiva8le action at any moment, and did indeed take each of those actions in different 8ranching realities. Doesn't a scenario like that deaden a person's agency just as much as one where their fate is decidedly etched in stone as a single path of unavoida8le decisions? Who exactly is that person who can and does take all conceiva8le actions, other than someone perfectly generic, who only appears to have unique predilections and motives when you examine the ar8itrary path they happen to occupy?</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: UM</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: 1 DONT KNOW</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Pardon the esoteric tangent. These are my instincts as a Hero of Light kicking in. It's hard for us to resist prattling on a8out matters like this.</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: OH GOD</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: L1K3 ROS3</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: Y34H SH3 N3V3R SHUTS UP 4BOUT 1T</span>
<span style="color: #008282">GC: NO OFF3NS3 &gt;:]</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: ::::)</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You may seek to understand your decisions and look for justice in their consequences. You may wonder why honora8le choices from the innocent are punished 8y 8anishment to a timeline in which everyone dies and all is gradually dissolved.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It helps to understand your role, not just as a hero who must overcome, 8ut as a single capillary within a much larger 8ioexistential system.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Think of it like circulatory system, where the veins and capillaries that do not help the overall flow of 8lood through the system are likely to wither and die. Those are doomed offshoots.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Reality itself is using you and many others to propagate its own existence. Strictly speaking, there is only one path to its successful propagation. 8ut it still permits you to make choices. Not all that are conceiva8le, 8ut some nevertheless, as dictated 8y who you are and the challenges you face. And you are free to make key decisions however you like, as long as you understand that some of these paths unfairly or not will lead to o8livion. 8ecause those choices do not contri8ute constructively to the perpetuation of all existence, including your own.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Such is the 8urden assumed 8y anyone who plays this game.</span>
