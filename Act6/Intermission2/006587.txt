<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: WELL LOOK, IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THIS LOPSIDED THING WHERE I SPILL ALL MY FEELINGS INTO IDIOTSPACE WHILE SOME SHIT HEAD YELLS AT ME.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: I WAS KIND OF THINKING THERE WOULD BE SOME GIVE AND TAKE, SINCE YOU PRESUMABLY SHARE A LOT OF MY THOUGHTS??</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OK WHATEVER. JUST SAY SOME STUFF ALREADY. ALL THAT SHIT I SAID TEN MINUTES AGO.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I WILL &quot;RIFF&quot; WITH YOU AND SOMEHOW PRETEND IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE I'M REHASHING A BUNCH OF LINES WRITTEN IN BARELY DRIED INK!!!</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: OK</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: WELL</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: I'M HAVING A HARD TIME EVEN PUTTING MY THOUGHTS INTO WORDS ABOUT THIS BIZARRE TREK THROUGH THE RING.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: AT FIRST IT WAS JUST BLAND AND UNEVENTFUL. BUT THAT WAS KIND OF A RELIEF, REMEMBER?</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING KILLED ALL THE TIME, OR TRYING TO RALLY A BUNCH OF UNCOOPERATIVE TROOPS TOWARD AN IMPOSSIBLE OBJECTIVE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YEAH.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: BUT THEN</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: AS IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH THAT SOMETIMES WE VISIT THESE CRAZY DREAM BUBBLES WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP...</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: WE STARTED PHYSICALLY PASSING THROUGH THEM TOO.</span>
