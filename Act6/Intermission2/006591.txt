<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: OH GET OVER YOURSELF, OUR TEN MINUTES IS ALMOST UP.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: IS SHE PUNISHING ME FOR SOMETHING?</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: I DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU HOW MUCH TIME SHE SPENDS GALLIVANTING AROUND THE METEOR WITH YOU KNOW WHO.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: NO YOU SURE AS FUCK DO NOT.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: AFTER ALL THIS TIME I *STILL* CAN'T TELL IF SHE'S SERIOUS ABOUT THAT, OR DOING IT TO FUCK WITH ME.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: WHAT DO YOU THINK? IS THERE SOMETHING LEGITIMATELY RED GOING ON THERE?</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: HOW CAN I COMMAND SUCH ABSOLUTE MASTERY OVER THE ROMANTIC SCIENCES YET REMAIN PERPLEXED BY THIS???</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: MAYBE I CAN'T GET A READ BECAUSE HE'S NOT A TROLL, AND THEREFORE HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK HE'S DOING?</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: IT'S LIKE TRYING TO DECIPHER AN INTRICATE COURTSHIP PROCESS BETWEEN AN ATTRACTIVE POTENTIAL MATESPRIT, AND SOME SORT OF VEGETABLE.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: LIKE IT DOESN'T COMPUTE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: FUCK, THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING LISTENING TO THIS, MAKE IT STOP.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: QUIET, I'M TALKING.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: I JUST FEEL LIKE MAYBE I'M PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN WITH HER.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: WHERE BEFORE THERE WAS MARGIN FOR ERROR, PROBABLY WAY MORE THAN I EVER DESERVED.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: AND NOW THAT'S IT. SHE'S TOTALLY HAD IT, AND THERE'S A NEW DUDE WITH CANDYBLOOD IN TOWN.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: HE'S JUST GOT IT ALL, DOESN'T HE? HE'S A MUCH BETTER ARTIST THAN I AM, FOR ONE THING.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: AND HIS HORNS ARE SO NUBBY, THEY DON'T EVEN EXIST! TALK ABOUT HITTING THE JACKPOT.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: AM I OFF BASE??</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WE JUST WENT OVER THIS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I DIDN'T GET IT THEN BECAUSE I WAS TOO BUSY WHINING AND FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF LIKE YOU'RE DOING NOW SO PIPE DOWN AND LISTEN.</span>
