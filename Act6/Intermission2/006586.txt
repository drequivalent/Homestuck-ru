<span style="color: #626262">CCG: THIS REALLY MAKES OUR CONVERSATIONS EASIER TO READ.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: REMEMBER THOSE INSANE BLOCKS OF GRAY ANGRY TEXT WE USED TO WRITE TOGETHER.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: WHAT WAS THAT</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: LIKE HALF A SWEEP AGO ALREADY?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: IS IT WEIRD THAT I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING BACK ON ALL THAT INSANITY WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FONDNESS?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: AT LEAST SHIT WAS HAPPENING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: IT'S SO BORING OUT HERE. AND LIVING WITH THE HUMANS IS JUST GETTING KIND OF</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: WEIRD.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: ANYWAY, THIS IS ACTUALLY A LOT MORE DECIPHERABLE. MAYBE YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">FCG: WELL HEY, CHECK IT OUT:</span> <span style="color: #626262">SHIT JUST GOT NOSTALGIC.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: LOOK AT THAT, I'M FEELING MORE SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THIS MORONIC CONVERSATION ALREADY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: OK, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO FROM ZERO TO DOUCHE LIKE IN THE BLINK OF A FUCKING GLANCE NUGGET.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">CCG: I JUST THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON TO SOMETHING WITH THE RED TEXT. I WAS TRYING TO PAY YOU A COMPLIMENT YOU ANTAGONIZING FUCK.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: I MEAN, WE ONLY EVER GOT IN THE HABIT OF TYPING IN GRAY TO HIDE OUR BLOOD COLOR, RIGHT?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: AND LIKE, 1) EVERYBODY KNOWS IT NOW, IT WAS THE WORST KEPT FUCKING SECRET EVER, AND 2) EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T, IT'S JUST US HERE, AND OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BOTH ALREADY KNOWN IT ALL OUR LIVES</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: UNLESS WE'RE BOTH SO NEUROTIC WE ACTUALLY STILL WANT TO ACT LIKE ITS A SECRET WE'RE KEEPING FROM EACH OTHER...</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CCG: BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK THE DAYS OF THAT ASTOUNDING DEGREE OF MENTAL ILLNESS ARE BEHIND US!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: (I WANT TO KILL MYSELF, BUT I CAN'T UNTIL THE CONVERSATION RUNS ITS COURSE. THIS IS THE WORST HELL IMAGINABLE.)</span>

<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: THERE. I THINK THIS SHOULD BE THE UNIVERSAL CONVENTION FOR WHEN TWO OF THE SAME PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: ONE GUY BITES THE BULLET AND TALKS IN RED.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: SERIOUSLY, ONE OF US HAS TO BE THE GROWN UP HERE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OH! I GET IT NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHEN I TYPE IN RED, IT'S SHOWY AND INSECURE, BUT WHEN YOU DO IT, YOU ARE SHOULDERING THE PRAGMATIC BURDEN OF A MARTYR, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS *MY* FUCKING IDEA TO DO THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE TEN MINUTES AGO!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YOU PIECE OF SHIT.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: OK!!! GOD DAMMIT, STOP BEING SO SENSITIVE. I FUCKING APOLOGIZE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT YOUR STUPID FEELINGS ALREADY SO WE CAN GET THIS NIGHTMARE OVER WITH.</span>
