<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: have you?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: nope :(</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i'm starting to think it's not going to happen. i wonder if we're just not sleeping at the same times?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i dont think thats it</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: for one thing, considering where we are, i dont think theres such a thing as &quot;the same time&quot; for us</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: heh. that's true.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: do you think the afterlife is just fucking with us, jade?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: maybe...</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but its probably more like the way it used to be with the clouds in skaia</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: they didnt always show you things, but when they did they were selective about what they would let you see</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: like they would make sure you saw whatever you needed to see to make sure things would go the right way</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i always thought i knew so much, but in retrospect they gave me only a tiny glimpse of the big picture!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that is so infuriating!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i guess!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: it never felt that way when all i was doing was looking up at some clouds</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i was happy to see whatever was there</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but i guess its different in a situation like this</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: when you miss your friends, and you kind of wish the dream bubbles would play along</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh well.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess it's only two more years.</span>
