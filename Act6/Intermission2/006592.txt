<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IS IT?? TELL ME, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU TREATED HER IN A WAY THAT COULD BE OBJECTIVELY CONSTRUED AS A FORM OF BLACK SOLICITATION?</span>

<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YEAH, A *HEALTHY* ONE, NOT ONE INVOLVING A DEMENTED LOUDMOUTH WHO CAN'T KEEP HIS SHIT UNDER CONTROL.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: LET ME ASK YOU, HOW MUCH OF THAT ANIMOSITY IS INNOCENT &quot;PLATONIC RAGE&quot;?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: COULD IT BE THAT SUBCONSCIOUSLY YOU WANT TO PUSH THINGS WITH HER ONTO CALIGINOUS TURF, MAYBE SEE HOW THINGS WORK OUT THERE?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SEE IF YOU CAN HAVE YOUR GRUB, AND CULL IT TOO??</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THAT WAY YOU HAVE HER ALL TO YOURSELF!</span>

<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE BECOME? YOU ARE THE SAD JOKE CHARACTER IN THE ROMCOM, YOU KNOW THE GUY I'M TALKING ABOUT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHO'S GREEDY AND INDISCRIMINATE ABOUT FILLING EVERY QUADRANT, TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS TO IT, AND IN THE END HAS FUCKALL TO SHOW FOR IT.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: I DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YOU KIND OF DO, FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER TEN MINUTES.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: NO, FUCK THAT, I'M SO DONE WITH YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YEAH, YOU PRETTY MUCH ARE, BECAUSE THE TEN MINUTES ARE ABOUT UP, AND I'LL BE GONE.</span>
