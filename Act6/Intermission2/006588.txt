<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: LIKE I THINK I COULD HANDLE IT BETTER IF IT WAS JUST ONE THING OR THE OTHER.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: LIKE *ONLY* THE MONOTONOUS DAY TO DAY DRUDGERY ON THE SAME GLOOMY FUCKING METEOR WITH THE SAME BUNCH OF RIDICULOUS PEOPLE, AND BASICALLY NOTHING TO DO EVER EXCEPT GET ALL UP IN EACH OTHER'S BUSINESS.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: OR *ONLY* A SWEEPS LONG SAFARI THROUGH AN EPHEMERAL REALM OF GHOST MEMORIES AND DEAD FRIENDS SHITTING AROUND IN A HAPHAZARD EXISTENTIAL CLUSTERFUCK.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: BUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH BOTH, IN TOTALLY RANDOM INTERVALS?</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: IT'S KIND OF TAKING ITS TOLL.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: &quot;I HEAR YOU MAN.&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THAT WAS WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BUT FOR THE RECORD, I GUESS I MEANT IT.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: YEAH.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: I MISS ALL OF MY DEAD FRIENDS A LOT.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: EVEN THE ASSHOLES! I MISS THEM TOO. MAYBE EVEN ESPECIALLY THEM, IN SOME PERVERSE WAY.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: AND I SHOULD BE RELIEVED THAT THEY ALL SEEM TO BE HAPPY IN SOME WAY, EVEN IF IT'S BY FLOATING NEBULOUSLY THROUGH DREAM PROJECTIONS WITH THEIR FREAKY BLANK EYES.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: AND I GUESS I AM RELIEVED ABOUT THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S LEFT ME UNSETTLED.</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000">CCG: FOR REASONS I CAN'T REALLY PUT MY FINGER ON.</span>
