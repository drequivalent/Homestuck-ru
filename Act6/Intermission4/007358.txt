What's that over there?? That looks like a GREAT thing to distract you from your awareness-addled reverie. 

It's some kind of blinking light, far off in the distance. It may be part of something else, like a larger structure. But it's so far away, the light is all you can see.

You have a feeling it's going to be a long walk.
