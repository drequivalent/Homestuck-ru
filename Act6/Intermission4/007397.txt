<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO MY GOAL IS. TO BURROW FUCK DEEP INTO THE CENTER OF EARTH.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">UNLOCK HIS DOOR.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">AND THEN DESTROY HIM.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Sort of.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You can fight him then and there if you want. But that won't do you much good. And not just because he'd probably kill you instantly.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You're better off listening to him.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Because he will make you an offer.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">By which I mean he will give you <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Choice</span>.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THE CHOICE TO DO WHAT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I won't tell you that.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FUCK. NO.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YOU WERE ON SUCH A ROLL. OF NOT BEING SHITTY.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">It's just a very important decision you will have to take into consideration once you hear it. Something unique to you and your journey.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Basically, if you accept his terms, your real adventure will begin. Your true planet will be unlocked, and a whole lot of other crazy shit will happen. It's best not to get bogged down in the details though.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">The bottom line is, by accepting, you will begin the most difficult game session anyone has ever attempted.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THAT'S BULLSHIT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY DO I GET SUCH A RAW DEAL.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Because you are being punished.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FOR WHAT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">For your hubris in embarking on a one player session.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">That's against the rules.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT RULES. WHERE ARE THESE RULES WRITTEN.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">They aren't written anywhere. They're just the rules.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Are the rules you and your sister followed written anywhere?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You just knew what they were, and you followed them. There were consequences for breaking them.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO THIS SHIT ASS SESSION. IS PUNISHING ME FOR. BEING TOO FULL OF MYSELF. AND KILLING MY SISTER??</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Pretty much.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHATEVER. I ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES. FOR DOING THOSE EXCELLENT THINGS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">JUST BRING IT ON.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I thought you'd feel that way.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS SESSION. ASIDE FROM THE FIRST STAGE BEING INSANELY BORING.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">It's called a dead session.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">So, there are three kinds of fucked up sessions, and yours is the worst.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">There's a null session, which is pretty much a normal session that's doomed to failure.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Everything works correctly. The sprites are prototyped, the battlefield can evolve, the Forge is present, Skaia can gestate a new universe... theoretically.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">But events conspire such that this never happens. Basically the players are doomed to fail.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Then there's a void session, which is the same as a null session, but without even having the potential for success.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Nothing is prototyped. The battlefield doesn't evolve. There's no Forge. It is completely inert.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">It has no chance of bearing fruit, at least not without some sort of miraculous external intervention. Like a deus ex machina.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">And then there's a dead session, which is a void session but worse. It's started by a single player. The kernelsprite collapses into a black hole, sucking the planet into it, and eventually the sun and entire solar system. There is no hope of creating a universe in such a session under any circumstance, not even with outside help. Victory and defeat in a dead session are dictated by totally different terms.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">One way of looking at it is, if you're fortunate enough to even get your quest started, it will be like playing the game on the extreme difficulty setting.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Hope you're up for that!</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OF COURSE I AM.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LET ME ASK YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IF YOU WERE THE MOST DEADLY DENIZEN OF ALL.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WOULD YOU WANT TO MESS WITH...</span>
