<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: I Understand</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: But What Youre Describing Is</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Hmm</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: No, what!</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: This Is Probably Not A Good Idea</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Oh, puleashe. You KNOW you have to tall me now.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: The Feelings You Are Having Are Actually Perfectly Normal Within The Framework Of Our Quadrant Based Romantic Tradition</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: I Dont Know If They Can Be Felt Naturally By Humans But The Way You Are Viewing Their Relationship Would Be Quite A Standard Response On Alternia</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Yeah??</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Yes</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: It Is Sanctioned Within The Ashen Quadrant</span>

<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: But It Served A Very Important Social Purpose For My People</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Such As In Situations Very Similar To The One You Described</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Where Two Parties Are Highly Drawn To Each Other Through Animosity</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: They May In Fact Be Perfect For Each Other In That Tumultuous Quadrant</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: But To Pursue The Relationship Would Be Chaos</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Much Like The Scenario You Laid Out The Two Kismeses If Left Unchecked Would Devastate All Their Other Relationships</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Those In Their Own Quadrants And Even Those In Other Peoples</span>
