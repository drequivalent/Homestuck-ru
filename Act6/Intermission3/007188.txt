<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: whaaat</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but you love this movie!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah, i know.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i mean... i thought i did.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's been kind of a long time since i last saw it. i really remember it being a lot better than this!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but now everything just seems so cheesy and stupid.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but you were making such a big deal about finally getting me to watch it with you on your birthday!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: you were going on and on about how i wouldnt be disappointed... but now youre saying you dont like it?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i don't know. i'm trying to like it. i WANT to like it.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i want to feel the same magic that was there all the other times i watched it.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i can't, because...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's just...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: not...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: good. :(</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: really?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i was actually kind of enjoying it!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: its very silly</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i really dont think its the kind of movie youre supposed to take all that seriously john</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i DID take it seriously!!!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess maybe that's kind of the point.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i always thought all this hokey bullshit was legitimately awesome and compelling.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what was i even thinking!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i dunno....</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but people can change their minds about things</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i think youre allowed to change your mind about a silly movie</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i used to LOVE the squiddles show when i was really young</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but as i got older i started to realize it wasnt as great as i thought it was</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i was just too young to see how it was actually a flagrant vehicle for selling merchandise</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and if you believed the conspiracy theorists it might have even been pushing some other dark hidden agendas.....</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: so i stopped liking the show itself as much but that didnt change the fact that i had a lot of fond memories about it</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i still loved all the cute characters and could enjoy it on a nostalgic level</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well, maybe later i'll be able to rekindle some nostalgic feelings about it.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but right now, i just feel like a dope for talking this up so hard.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: what is even the problem with it?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: ive just been watching this and thinking, yup, i can see why john was so obsessed with this movie...</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: its funny!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's just non stop terrible action movie cliches!</span>
