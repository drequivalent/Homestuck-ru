<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: I'm yam completally in command of my faculities.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: faculity isnt a word check mate</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: this kinda strikes me as a sort of misappropriation of alchemy</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like fucking with the mystical technology of creation to whip up some moonshine just seems</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: i dunno man</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like the square one of juice</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Yes, tha's the POINT!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Apples are stalartingly difficulf to reproduce.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: We take for granned our ability to take idealized intsances ofeven quie comlicated objects and conshure them from the void.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: But compalexity implies a heavilly recombinatife nature.. So.. so many things are synesthized from a series of mushh simpler ideas!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: To those ennities capable of, of conceshualization and absraction, an apple is as closed to being a noshushnally irredushible object as it gets....</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Ahem. *<span style="font-style: italic">Notionally</span>,</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: **Irr, ed, <span style="font-style: italic">ducible</span>.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: uh</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Exaaalley/.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Thusis why apples are sush indivisible symbols, when it comes to thefield of ideas and their reducshunistHIC!!!!! reductionishtic essence from the perispective of humans in paticular.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Both from a stantpoint of cultrulal and mytholurgical singificence,, and from a pratical one a swell, if you happen to fine yourself acshualy trying to ENGINEEEer one.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Why do you thing, HIC!!! Why do you think Adam mand Eve were punished for biting in to one??</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: They attemped to pentetrate an indivisible unit, uf fundamenetal knowledge. To consume the interior of a thought whish cantot be reduced any further.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: This knowleshe was for BIDDEN..! Hic. So humanity was forever bandished to live in sin, and, hass strive ever sinse to redeem isself from the hubrinse of this innallectual foily.</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Or what about, the tale of Isaac Newdon under the tree?? He was BONKED on the head by an apple.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Not reallyan apple though... an atomic idea. An emlemental unit of inspripation itself, id clocked him right on then noggin.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: And this indivisible notion colliding with hish awareness, much like.. . a high speed partical fired to create a nuculear chain reacation, jarred from the void a more profund unnerstand, HIC, ing of the intrinsic nature of nothiness. Thatis,. Gravivitation.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Of course thess stories are acutually bullshit. They didn't happen in realaity. But thef act that they'rare bullshit makes them more inshresting.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Men have crefted many stories that are bullshit out of symbols risen from the abyss of coinsciousness withou necesharily knowing whath e fuck they were doing or saying, as they flounered around for some truth.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Bust in spite of themseleves they would for howefer briefly cross through a ray of light regarless. Becuss of the sbymbols. Dave.. The symbols hol dall the power.</span>
