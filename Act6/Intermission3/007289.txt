<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i take it you were pretty good friends back on your planet?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You could say that.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: There's a pretty loaded history 8etween us. It's pro8a8ly 8est not to get into it.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: None of that matters anymore anyway, it was so long ago. You know how it is.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: um. sure?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Issues 8etween people seem like such a 8ig deal when they're happening. 8ut then you die, and time just goes on, and on........ then on some more.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: If enough time passes, shit that used to 8e a 8ig deal kind of stops mattering.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Ok, full disclosure. I used to do a lot of terri8le things to Tavros.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Once I launched him off a cliff and paralyzed him. And if that wasn't 8ad enough, I spent sweeps mocking him for the disa8ility I caused! Haha.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Oh yeah. Then I killed him.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh, right. i remember you said you killed someone that you cared about. i guess this is him?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Mm hm.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut like I said, that's suuuuuuuuch old news now, it might as well not have even happened.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Tavros doesn't give a shit a8out that stuff anymore.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: hEY, wAIT, mAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T, SPEAK FOR ME?</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: i STILL KIND OF THINK THAT STUFF WAS ALL PRETTY MEAN, eVEN THOUGH IT WAS FOREVER AGO,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: iT'S JUST, i HAVE CHOSEN TO BE THE BIGGER MAN, aND NOT HOLD IT AGAINST LIKING YOU,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Hahahaha! John, can you 8elieve this guy?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: This is the kind of shit I have to deal with all the time.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: oH GOD,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: nO, tIME OUT, i'M FLAGGING THIS, vRISKA, aS TERRIBLE BEHAVIOR,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Tavros, the 8igger man is only ACTUALLY the 8igger man if he doesn't refer to himself as the 8igger man. That's kind of the point?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Unless the intent is to produce some form of socially awkward comic relief, which let's face it, is what you're all a8out.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut that's what I like a8out you.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: yES, }:)</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: hmm, i feel like... maybe we got sidetracked there?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: maybe you should tell me more about this english guy.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: frankly, it seems like i'm usually one of the last people to learn about stuff like this, and it's starting to make me feel like a bit of a tool.</span>
