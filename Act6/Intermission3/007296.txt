<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that is pretty neat.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so does that mean you know where the treasure is now?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: No, 8ecause the map isn't complete yet!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Needs more cracks so we can plot the rest of the course. All we're a8le to do now is head in the right general direction.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: So ironically in order to prevent reality from 8eing destroyed, we need to w8 for it to 8e damaged further. In fact, we're 8etter off encouraging it!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: encouraging it?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what, you mean like, making him mad so he breaks more... uh...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: nothingness?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yes, 8ut it has to 8e strategic. We have to somehow lead him in the direction of the places we want him to damage.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Specifically, the places where the route dead-ends. Wherever we need new points of reference to keep going.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so that means you have to piss him off i guess.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Not really. He's already pissed off. I think he's just permanently that way?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It's more a8out getting his attention. Using the right 88! Like going fishing.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut to do that, you gotta know what he really wants. Like what motiv8tes him. I mean, 8esides indiscrimin8tely killing dead children and huge tentacle monsters.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i am guessing you have an idea what that might be?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Sure. The rumor is he's trying to find that dead alien girl I mentioned, and kill her ghost for good.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: If he catches on to the fact that some of us are looking for her too, and thinks we're hot on her trail, he'll pro8a8ly start following us around and wreaking havoc wherever we go.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: We just have to make sure we're in the right place when he tries to kill us. Oh, also try not to actually die again while we're at it. Haha.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so the bait is really you.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Sort of! It's actually more the 8ogus idea that we'll lead him to the cheru8, 8ecause we're looking for her too. Which we're o8viously not.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: There's some manipul8tion involved.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok. how do you know he'll go for it? i mean, how will he actually know you're &quot;looking&quot; for her?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: That's a pretty good question. Have to admit, I don't have everything quite figured out yet.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: yEEAAAAAAAAAAH,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Shhhhhhh! I'm still talking!</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: bUT, tHAT'S NEVER NOT BEING THE CASE, aLWAYS,</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Nice sentence, genius! Anyway, like I was saying........</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I'm hoping my exploits can spread throughout the ring 8y word of mouth. Tales of my legend, you know?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Then once he catches on, he'll come looking for us, and then presuma8ly go apeshit with his rain8ow laser 8reath. Metaphysical cataclysm ensues.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that sounds... optimistic?</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: yEAH, eXACTLY,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: sEE, tHIS TO ME, mAYBE SPEAKS TO THE DANGER,</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: oF HAVING SELF ESTEEM THAT IS UNREASONABLY HIGH,</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: heh.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Oh, shut up.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I said it's a work in progress!!!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: We might need to make a 8igger spectacle of ourselves somehow. Get more people involved. I don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It does seems like he's more drawn toward gr8ter concentr8tions of ghosts.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: There's still plenty of time to figure it out. That's one thing a8out 8eing dead. There's always more time.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Plus, needless to say, lady luck will ALWAYS 8e on our side! ::::)</span>
