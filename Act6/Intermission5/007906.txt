<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: With each planet he destroys, he will 8e awarded a new leprechaun follower.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Even if a planet was destroyed in the 8r8k, he will still 8e awarded that planet's leprechaun upon destroying the planet preceding it. Sort of like a two for one deal!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: wait.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: leprechauns??</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Yes, John!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I'm delighted to see you have pounced on what is clearly the most interesting part of the story thus far.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Leprechauns are a fascin8ting mythical race, although there is some dispute among scholars as to whether they are actually a 8reed of gnome.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ...</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I can't say I 8lame you for 8eing speechless. There are no dou8t hundreds of questions swirling in your head at once a8out these wonderful creatures.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Where do I even 8egin? You must forgive me, I find it very difficult to resist going on at length a8out them. I just think they are so gr8.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: For instance, I can and have given lectures for weeks at a time on their marvelous and widely varying magical a8ilities.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: More intriguing yet would 8e any medium-to-longform harangue on the topic of their culture and customs, most of which revolve around luck.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut most captiv8ting of all, and the su8ject upon which I will now assiduously expound, would 8e the positively scintill8ting su8ject of leprechaun romance.</span>
