<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: what do you actually want from her</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: do you want her to stop drinking faygo and falling asleep in puddles of red fructose corn slobber</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: or do you want her to somehow address the root of those habits and cut all that out for good</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: YES! I WANT HER TO DO THAT!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: THE LATTER THING.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: yeah i can understand where youre coming from</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: but in situations like this i think you need to remind yourself theres only so much you can do for somebody</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: and maybe they arent going to want or need your help and you just have to figure out how to deal with that</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: like at some point in your life one of your friends might start spending all her time with a guy you think is bad news</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: and you have to decide if you need to intervene as a friend or just let it go because people can change or drift apart or whatever because thats just something that happens</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: DAVE</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: YOUR WISDOM, MY GOD</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: there comes a time in every young womans life when she has to come to terms with the decision to gradually morph into a juggalo while all her friends and loved ones watch in dismay</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: terezi has strolled through the dark carnival and taken a great brooding whiff of that decisions festive asshole and the choice she has made is all too clear</span>
