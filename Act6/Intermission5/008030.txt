You leave Damara's room and great Caesar's stab wound what is even going on here. <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span> where the hell are you leading us you ask. He says it's the Doc's old apartment. Really posh digs. Primo location too, at least it was before the universe exploded. Why are there giant holes in the walls through which can be seen an abundance of blinding green plasma, you inquire. He says because the apartment is now floating somewhere inside a huge sun. A sun you say. Well shit. No wonder it's so hot you could cook breakfast on your cranial plates. Hiding out in the middle of a big sun doesn't sound like a real tenable predicament, does it <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>. No boss, he supposes it does not. Sounds like it's actually kind of a shitty predicament, doesn't it <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>. Yes boss, he supposes it does. A predicament defying any sense of reason, safety, physical comfort, and most laws of science probably. He wouldn't know about that boss. You'll have to ask a scientist. You got a sassy mouth on you <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>, you say to <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>. A real sassy mouth.

He says if you don't want to stay, that's fine. There are contingencies in place. Contingencies you say? He says Doc's suite had an emergency exit which the gang could flee through whenever things got too hot to handle. Circumstances, he says, which never once presented themselves, until now, in the most literal way possible. Yeah. Yeah you say. Because of the sun. Yes he says. Because of the sun.

Well what are you waiting for <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>. Keep leading the way.
