<span style="color: #2ed73a">I NEED MORE ANSWERS. VERY QUICKLY.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I thought you had given up on getting answers from me.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO. I JUST HAVE NOT HAD TIME.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THE BOMB COUNTDOWNS ARE GETTING SO SHORT. THIS IS GETTING HARD. IT'S NOT FAIR.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I really don't see how it's any less fair than being allowed to solicit the omniscient narrator of your quest for answers.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Nobody else who plays this game gets to do that. What makes you so special?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BUT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID I WAS SPECIAL.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I shouldn't have said that.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Now you're strutting around, all thinking you're special.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I AM SPECIAL!</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I know.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LESS BULLSHIT. MORE ANSWERS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I HAVE COLLECTED MORE FROG MEN.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT DO THEY DO.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Frog men???</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You are getting really esoteric with your headcanons now.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">MY WHAT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">And what makes you so sure they are all men?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Have you sexed them?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FUCK YOU. AND YOUR RIBALD INSINUATIONS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FROG MEN IS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">No, I mean determined their sex.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Do you even know how?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I DON'T CARE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THEY'RE ALL MEN. BECAUSE I SAY THEY ARE. AND I WANT THEM TO BE.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IF I BELIEVE HARD ENOUGH IN THEM BEING MEN.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THEN THAT FACT BECOMES ABSOLUTELY INDISPUTABLE AS A PERMANENT MAN REALITY.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">It does?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">ARE YOU TELLING ME. THAT YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE. THAT MY ENTOURAGE OF DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">CONSISTS OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN BOYS???</span>
<span style="color: #000000">No.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I mean, I don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">I'm not there, so I can't sex them to be sure.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YOU FUCKING PERVERT.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">That's not what sexing means you little shit!</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I'D LIKE TO CHANGE THE TOPIC. AWAY FROM THE LUST YOU ARE FEELING FOR MY HANDSOME FROG MEN.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I HAVE OBTAINED SOME STRIPE HATS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YELLOW STRIPE HAT. BLUE STRIPE HAT. RED STRIPE HAT.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT DO THEY DO.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Why do you always want me to spoil stuff for you?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Why can't you be at least a little scientifically inquisitive, and find out what they can do yourself?</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Have you tried injuring blue stripe hat yet?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY WOULD I HURT HIM. HE IS MY LOYAL MINION, ALBEIT ONE WHO IS OVERWEIGHT AND APPARENTLY USELESS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">ANYWAY. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR SCIENCE. JUST TELL ME.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Fine.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Blue stripe hat randomly time travels somewhere if you injure him.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Red stripe hat can also travel through time, but only using fire as a gateway.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Yellow stripe hat is a tailor.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">A TAILOR.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YOU MEAN. SOMEONE WHO SEWS STUFF.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Yes. A damn good one, too.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THAT'S NOT A POWER. IT'S MORE LIKE. A FUCKING HOBBY.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHICH HAS NO VALUE TO ME WHATSOEVER.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">If you want to be a bigshot time traveler, you're going to need a good tailor.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Everyone knows that.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO. MAKES NO SENSE.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">What if some day you get some sweet new threads? Who will maintain your wardrobe for you??</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Do you think you'll wear that tee shirt and those stupid suspenders all your life?</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WILL NEVER STOP WEARING MY AWESOME SUSPENDERS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO ONE CAN MAKE ME. NOT EVEN MY TAILOR.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Whatever you say.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You're wasting time again. Better hurry up and conquer this planet so you can find Eggs.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT??</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Whoops. I mean purple stripe hat.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Forget I called him that.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OH. YES.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THESE NEXT FEW GUYS.</span>
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I HAVE A FEELING. THE FARTHER I GO. THE MORE USEFUL AND EXCITING THE FROG MEN ARE STARTING TO BE.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">You won't be disappointed.</span>
