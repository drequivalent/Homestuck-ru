<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: We've amassed a coalition of eager volunteers ready to lay down their ghost lives for a worthy cause.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you mean fighting lord english?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: When we're ready for that, yes. 8ut we need the treasure first.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: So for now they're sailing well ahead of us in large num8ers to attract his attention, so he can do more damage to the ring and fill out the rest of our maps.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: We should 8e very gr8teful for their 8ravery. They are making a no8le sacrifice for us all.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: (bRAVERY, yEAH, rIGHT,)</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: (i'M MOSTLY SURE SHE'S MIND CONTROLLING THEM,)</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: God DAMMIT, Tavros.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: We really don't need your play 8y play commentary on everything!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: wait, you're mind controlling all those ghosts?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: No!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Well, not all of them.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Once you group enough together, others tend to latch on to the mo8 out of curiosity. We trolls have a way of clustering together naturally.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You've got to understand, John. Most of these people are pretty self a8sor8ed. They just needed a little 8it of persuasion to join the cause.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: word</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah, but...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: isn't that still kind of, um...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: dickish?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut all these stu88orn jackasses are going to dou8le die anyway if we don't all work together and kill this guy!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: This is WAR, John. In times of war, difficult decisions have to 8e made with the lives of many.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Just think of me as a general giving orders to my troops. It just happens that the orders are a little more direct in this case.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: hey serket deuce</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: lets not lose track a whos actually in charge of this shit mkay</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yeah yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: All hail Her Imperious Teen Condescension, the fresh new face of tyranny, Supreme Admiral Peixes.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: At this time I would like to motion for a fifteen minute 8owing 8r8k so that we may demonstr8te our reverence for this 8old, spunky leader.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: yessssss</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Tavros, stop 8owing. That was a joke.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: no keep doin that</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: lower swabby</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: LOW-ER</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: face on the fuckin deck</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: yes just like that perfect</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: how do you mind control so many ghosts at once?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: isn't that kind of hard?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Well, I do have a little help.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: John, did I mention?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: My ancestor........</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: She is THE 8EST.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she is?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I must admit, I was not in favor of the idea at first.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut Vriska made a very strong case for using our com8ined powers in this way.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: In a perfect reality, no one would have to get hurt. 8ut the stakes are too high to 8e shying away from such measures.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: See what I mean??</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: The 8est.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: uh.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It has 8een wonderful spending so much time on this adventure with my descendant.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Not just 8ecause it's helped me get to know her 8etter, 8ut 8ecause it's opened my eyes to things a8out myself I was never really in touch with.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: There are certain capa8ilities within me I have never quite 8een a8le to face, and she's helped me realize I've 8een hiding from them all my life, and well 8eyond.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It must 8e true what they used to say on my world. That if you really want to know who you are, look to the legacy left 8ehind 8y your ancestor.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I think that wisdom works in 8oth directions!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Well put, Marquise. I've always felt the exact same way!</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: PUKE</span>

<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: There's no reason to 8e jealous, Meenah. You know nothing has changed a8out our friendship.</span>
