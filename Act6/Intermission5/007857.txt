<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: We've amassed a coalition of eager volunteers ready to lay down their ghost lives for a worthy cause.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">ДЖОН: you mean fighting lord english?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: When we're ready for that, yes. 8ut we need the treasure first.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: So for now they're sailing well ahead of us in large num8ers to attract his attention, so he can do more damage to the ring and fill out the rest of our maps.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: We should 8e very gr8teful for their 8ravery. They are making a no8le sacrifice for us all.</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">ТАВРОС: (bRAVERY, yEAH, rIGHT,)</span>
<span style="color: #a15000">ТАВРОС: (i'M MOSTLY SURE SHE'S MIND CONTROLLING THEM,)</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: God DAMMIT, Tavros.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: We really don't need your play 8y play commentary on everything!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">ДЖОН: wait, you're mind controlling all those ghosts?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: No!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: Well, not all of them.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: Once you group enough together, others tend to latch on to the mo8 out of curiosity. We trolls have a way of clustering together naturally.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: You've got to understand, John. Most of these people are pretty self a8sor8ed. They just needed a little 8it of persuasion to join the cause.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">МИНА: word</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">ДЖОН: yeah, but...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">ДЖОН: isn't that still kind of, um...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">ДЖОН: dickish?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: 8ut all these stu88orn jackasses are going to dou8le die anyway if we don't all work together and kill this guy!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: This is WAR, John. In times of war, difficult decisions have to 8e made with the lives of many.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: Just think of me as a general giving orders to my troops. It just happens that the orders are a little more direct in this case.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">МИНА: hey serket deuce</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">МИНА: lets not lose track a whos actually in charge of this shit mkay</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: Yeah yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: All hail Her Imperious Teen Condescension, the fresh new face of tyranny, Supreme Admiral Peixes.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: At this time I would like to motion for a fifteen minute 8owing 8r8k so that we may demonstr8te our reverence for this 8old, spunky leader.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">МИНА: yessssss</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: Tavros, stop 8owing. That was a joke.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">МИНА: no keep doin that</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">МИНА: lower swabby</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">МИНА: LOW-ER</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">МИНА: face on the fuckin deck</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">МИНА: yes just like that perfect</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">ДЖОН: how do you mind control so many ghosts at once?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">ДЖОН: isn't that kind of hard?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: Well, I do have a little help.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: John, did I mention?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: My ancestor........</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: She is THE 8EST.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">ДЖОН: she is?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: I must admit, I was not in favor of the idea at first.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: 8ut Vriska made a very strong case for using our com8ined powers in this way.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: In a perfect reality, no one would have to get hurt. 8ut the stakes are too high to 8e shying away from such measures.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: See what I mean??</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: The 8est.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">ДЖОН: uh.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: It has 8een wonderful spending so much time on this adventure with my descendant.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: Not just 8ecause it's helped me get to know her 8etter, 8ut 8ecause it's opened my eyes to things a8out myself I was never really in touch with.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: There are certain capa8ilities within me I have never quite 8een a8le to face, and she's helped me realize I've 8een hiding from them all my life, and well 8eyond.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: It must 8e true what they used to say on my world. That if you really want to know who you are, look to the legacy left 8ehind 8y your ancestor.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: I think that wisdom works in 8oth directions!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ВРИСКА: Well put, Marquise. I've always felt the exact same way!</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">МИНА: PUKE</span>
