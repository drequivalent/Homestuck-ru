So this is it huh you say. Why's he keep the exit in the room with the clock anyway? <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span> says the exit's in the room with the clock because the exit IS the clock. You say you see. You look the clock up and down. Doesn't look the same as you remember. It was a lot fancier when you smashed it with the <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>. You mean the crowbar. All purple and gold and... ticking. As if deciding the fate of someone you don't know or care about. Someone who doesn't understand a golden opportunity when she sees it. <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/scorpio.gif" border="0" /><span style="color: #005682">sdkljfhkldhfsdkhfk</span><img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/scorpio.gif" border="0" /> Someone whose behavior may have been controversial, and whose sentence apparently had to be arbitrated by a magic timepiece. Just as well you smashed it. That way nobody could outsource their judgment to the verdict of a stupid clock. Yes you definitely thought all that now. Wait. What happened to the pendulum? The ball thingy you mean. <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span> says it broke. You see. Alright.

Anyway none of that matters now. How are you supposed to exit through this thing? Guess you have to open it? Yes he says. How you say. He says oh you know. Gotta pry it open. If only they had a tool with which to pry. Perhaps a tool which is notorious for its prying ability, which also happens to be its sole purpose. You wouldn't happen to know where such a tool might be, would you, he asks? No, he supposes not. There he goes again with that smart mouth. Nothing but sass from this guy. You're starting to miss your old right hand man. At least when he got sick of your shit, he would just turn around and light a cigarette.
