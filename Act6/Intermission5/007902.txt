<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: It meant that he would only have to conquer twelve planets instead.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: This 8it of good fortune could very well have 8een the difference which allowed him to overcome a nearly impossi8le challenge.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: His task was to destroy all of these planets in order, each within a time allowance that gets shorter with every planet.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: To destroy a planet, first it must 8e conquered.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: He would have to overcome all forces of resistance on the planet, and ultim8tely defeat whatever powerful underling ruled there.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: Then, much like he did to unlock the quest in the first place, he would have to travel to the planet's core.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: There he would retrieve a 8om8, and return to the surface.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: If he did not accomplish this in time, the 8om8 would deton8 in the core, and the game would 8e lost automatically.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: The 8om8 is not powerful enough to destroy the planet alone.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">АРАНЕЯ: In fact, its purpose is not to damage the planet at all, 8ut to move it.</span>
