<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: i dont necessarily share their point of view on the meaning of this endeavor though</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: they consider this to be a great clash between good and evil</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: but i prefer to look at the coming battle as a matter of housekeeping</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: in the end all loops must be tidied up</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: even his</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, but what about your friends!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: don't you care about them?</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: of course i do!</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: i love all my friends</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: then why do you seem so...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: cheerful?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: when so many of them are getting zapped by lasers.</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: do i seem cheerful about that</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: kinda!</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: i apologize if that is the way i am behaving</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: it is not true though</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: i think i look at death differently than most</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: and it is fair to say this attitude extends to death after death as well</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: i have learned to be at ease with the cessation of being in any form it takes</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: but i am not nor will i ever be the monsters handmaid</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: so please believe that i would never take joy from the destruction of any soul</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: however you must realize that it is only by the grace of the horrorterrors that so many have been allowed to continue existing for so long</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: they have persisted for ages beyond their time just as he has</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: as such it seems to me his rampage is just another kind of housekeeping</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: while he rounds the ring undoing the work of the gods we must prepare for his undoing as well</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: to ready the manor for the lords arrival so to speak :)</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i'm sorry, maybe i spaced out through some of that.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i'm still not sure what you're talking about.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: maybe you could just simplify it for me.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: are you a good guy or a bad guy?</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: i dont like to think of myself in those terms</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: but i do try to be nice to people!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: dammit.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, could you just... maybe...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: give me an idea of what it is you actually want out of all this?</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: what i want?</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: hmmm</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: thats a pretty good question</span>
