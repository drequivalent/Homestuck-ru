<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: kay then</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what do you want me 2 say</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: for you to autobelieve in</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hmm.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Everything, I guess. I'd like to get completely up to speed, if possible.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yeah</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: im pretty sure i already said everything</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: want me to just</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: sayit all again.....</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Some reiteration certainly couldn't hurt.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But this time I won't work so hard to sift the fantastical from the plausible.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so like</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: stuffs i said about my mom or</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Sure.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok well fors tarters</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: she really is the notable author u know</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh, I know that!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That was always something I had no trouble believing, considering the public documentation even reclusive celebrities receive.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And frankly, the family resemblance is obvious.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yup</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Anyway, it would be disingenuous if I found your relation far fetched, since we're all apparently related to noteworthy people. It's just one of those funny things.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: true dat</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: then</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what else can i talk about</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like her occolt majyyks and stuff</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: because i dont know a whole lot about the mayjjykks</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: besides th fact that theyre all real as shit can get</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Maybe we should start at the very beginning.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but the begninning was a hecka long time a go</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Do you remember around when we first started talking?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: y</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And you claimed you were the one making my pumpkins disappear?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hahAHA</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *aha</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: y :3</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You later proceeded to try to prove to me that what you were saying was true.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But none of your attempts thereafter would ever bear any fruit, pardon the pun.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: k but it aint pardoned because a pumpkin aint even a fruit</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its a big orange porch thing for holloween numbnuts</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes, I know what pumpkins are. It was a joke, silly.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What I'm trying to say is, in thinking back to those days, when you couldn't verify your claims, it made me think the whole thing was a big ruse.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And I think this unfortunately began a pattern of mistrust. It was always hard to rule out the possibility that you could be joking about other things as well.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yeah</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but its not my fault i mean appeafrification tech is notoriously unreliable</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: remember</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i xplained this</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i cant just always appearify stuff from you any time i want</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i can only take stuff im &quot;allowed&quot; 2 which is pmuch random</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like stuff that by takin id be messing up the time line cause that stuff is supposed to be there and serve some funciton it hasnt served yet</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so most of the time if i try all i get is slime on my end</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but pumpins 4 some reason are a lil easier to take i dunno why</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like they are specifically and arbitrorily unhinged from spacetime</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: is spooooko</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *ky</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I couldn't begin to explain the science behind such a technology either.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But I guess the important thing is, regardless of how or why it works, this is a story you continue to stand by?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That is, you are still taking credit for the mysterious disappearance of all those pumpkins I grew years ago?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: f yeah</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i so gonked your gaurds jane</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yeah so</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It's not any sort of revelation, or statement for me to take at face value.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Dadburn it. This isn't that difficult!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And for the record, it's not great.</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It's not about pity!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It's more like a gesture I'm trying to make.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Or maybe that's not quite right.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It has more to do with setting things right for myself than making it up to you.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Does that make sense?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: .............</span>
