<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yeah, you're right. The scenario is too pedestrian for you.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It would probably be a lot more effective putting yourself in danger and letting him be the hero.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That's pretty much what he wants, right? To be a cheesy action film hero, with his twin berettas and silly shorts.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: A man of triumph on the silver screen. Standing tall on some fucking mountain. Conquering ruins, clutching a skull, and kissing a dude.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Pure Hollywood.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: See, this is why even if I did have a specific plan, I wouldn't go into details with you.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You would just fuck it up. You're the biggest unknown quantity here.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which is pretty weird, considering you're a virtual reflection of my own thought processes.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You're making a mistake not leveling with me.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I am totally on your side, man.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: All of my machinations have been devised with your interests in mind.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: And anyway, it's too late for you to play &quot;damage control&quot; with me. My shit is in motion, and now we're beyond the pail.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Pretty sure it's pale.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Is it, now?</span>
