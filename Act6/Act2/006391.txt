<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Anyway, if you're still there.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I wouldn't call my &quot;feelings&quot; ironic.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Though evidently, I would enclose them in quotes.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: They're more like an echo of feelings once established in a biological context, though perhaps had not particularly well materialized at that point in my life.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Or his life.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Whatever.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: They still feel real sometimes, and it can be easy to get carried away with them.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But most of the time they present themselves as dense bodies of abstraction to be evaluated, like any kind of information.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It's fair to say the feelings I have ABOUT my feelings are more genuine expressions of emotion than the ground level feelings themselves.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Does that make sense?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yes</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: sory distacted</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That's fine.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: So to underwhelmingly answer your question, no, I don't think I'm really &quot;into Jake.&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Not so much as occasionally being subject to heavily arresting recalls of conflicted, incipient preteen episodes on the subject.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm not sure I can be &quot;into&quot; someone in a way you understand.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Not that it would even matter if I was.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm glasses.</span>
