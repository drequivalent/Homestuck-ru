<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: RLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY??????</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Sigh.</span>
[<a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006333" target="_blank" class="postlink">CONTINUED PREVIOUSLY</a>]


<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Anyway, I won't distract you for much longer.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I just felt the need to tip you off to this eight hundred ton gorilla dragging its knuckles across the horizon.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: will this gorilla</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: eat thos bonanas</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: flying out of the roof u said</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: No airborne fruit will be safe.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I guess this is to be presented as something like a word of caution.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: If it's me going through with this, hypothetically,</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm not dropping some limp wristed shucks buster on his ass, and praying to the horse gods of irony for reciprocation.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: There will be no rocking back and forth on pigeon-toed feet, while my face flushes with the blood of a thousand timid bishies.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I will not hold one tentative hand behind my head like a flustered asshole from an Asian cartoon, nor will an oversized bead of sweat overlap ludicrously with my visage.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: If it's me, I'm going all out.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Oceans will rise. Cities will fall. Volcanoes will erupt.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: uuh</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: What I'm saying is, it's going to be a scene, and bystanders need to brace themselves.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: about when is the big scene happenin</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Probably after the game begins.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I expect he'll hold off on playing his hand until he and Jake are in the session.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He's taken certain measures.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: For some reason, I think he's latched on to this notion that functioning as the client for a player is customarily a one way pass to makeout city with that player.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Everything with him, and me, is a matter of assiduous tactical forethought. Makin' a play to get his jones on for the J-man is no different.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: not sure what any of this quiet means but it sounds spactacular</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i cant wait</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: tho im still kinda torn</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: about how 2 feel about his chances vs janes chances</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what do i say to jane about this???</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its hard being as totey sweet a friend as me</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its hard and no 1 understanks</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *lul</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Sorry to hear that.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: As ever, I remain an automatonous and dispassionate witness of the oddity that is human interaction, while maintaining no investment in either outcome.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yeah bs</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: anyway looks like i have to go</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i have to proves some shit to jane</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Prove what?</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It seems you just said madrigogs.</span>
