<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Very well then.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Jeez i mustve really misread that one! I feel like kind of a bone head now.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Are you sure the answers no?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I guess...</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That...</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Sure was the thing I said! Ha ha.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes fair enough.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I guess i did put you on the spot there didnt i.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You know it may sound cocky of me but i really was not prepared for this answer!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You must think im just this epic friggin tool now. Couldnt say id disagree if you did.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: No!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh my God, what am I saying here?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jake, I didn't mean it! I didn't want to make you feel that way!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Now jane lets not backpedal here.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Youve spoken the truth and i greatly appreciate and respect you for that.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But now that i think about it you know what?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: ...</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: No? :(</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Please dont take this the wrong way but your answer is actually kind of a relief!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It is?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I consider you to be a lovely lady of the highest caliber and i really think any gent worth his salt would be a huge bozo to let the chance to go steady with you slip through his fingers.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ive even given the possibility some thought myself.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You have?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sure im only human jane im going to entertain lets say certain ideas. What ifs. You know?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Like what if we did meet up some day? And you asked me out or something. Im sure id say yes given all weve been through together and then well who knows?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You would??</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Probably but im kind of babbling here. The point is those are all just silly daydreams about stuff and about your feelings for me that i was projecting on you which werent even real.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And now that weve been honest with each other about this we can kind of move on and just be great friends.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Friends!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh boy!!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And its a load off to be honest because that was lot to think about on top of everything else!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Everything else?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Things are kind of complicated for me jane. With you and roxy and dirk and his crazy responder and now...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well its a tangled web lets just put it that way.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I don't think I'm following.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: There are a fuckload of irons in the fire jane!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So many irons in the fire. Such a tangled web. It is a web full of flaming irons.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And mixed metaphors, apparently?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Exactly. See? You get it.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I really don't, Jake.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh son of a bitch!</span>
