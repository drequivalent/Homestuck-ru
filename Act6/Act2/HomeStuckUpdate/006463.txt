<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Alrighty, I am in my father's study!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I have kindly asked Mr. Sebastian to hand over the reins to this silly computer shaped like a man.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What now?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Now you have access to a clean computer, for one thing.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Soon we can get started going through the steps necessary to launch the session.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh hell.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Another interruption.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I should step away for a moment to take this message.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He's probably right, I'm distracted by too much bullshit at once lately.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Who's right?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Me.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jane, I'm going to leave you with the responder for a little while.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe he can help you get started. Think you can handle that, dude?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm all about being able to handle that, you don't even know.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I will perform an acrobatic pirouette on to the handle, wherein the handle literally represents my ability to handle that thing.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, got it. You and the handle are tight.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We don't need a whole thing about this.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Once I stick the landing on the handle like a champ, I am going to get down on one knee, pull out a ring, and propose to it.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The handle I mean.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Implying we will be married.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: :B</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, long story short, you and the handle fuck gratuitously. Nuff said.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Try not to say I never gave you any responsibilities, or never took you seriously as a viable conscious being with free will.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Also, please try not to make me regret this.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You have nothing to worry about. Go talk to the alien.</span>
