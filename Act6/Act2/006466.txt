<span style="color: #929292">UU: i think their romantic practices are particUlarly esoteric.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: actUally, i have written hUndreds of pages examining the striking differences between hUman and troll romance, as well as reprodUctive habits, as the comparison makes for a marveloUs case stUdy in xenobiocUltUral differences.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as long as i am sharing specUlation with yoU, perhaps yoU woUld like to read my essays?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i coUld even paste each page right here in sUccession, and allow yoU to read them back to back to back to back to back to back! ^u^</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh hell no.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ah.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes, yoU're right of coUrse. i'm probably getting carried away as UsUal.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: forgive my enthUsiasm, it's jUst that i so rarely have anyone to talk to who shares my passion for these matters.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: certainly not my cUrmUdgeonly coplayer. &gt;:U</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I mean, not that all that stuff wouldn't be fascinating to pore through, on some level.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But we kind of have things to do here.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Remember you were gonna take a nap?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: by jove, the nap!!!</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes, i really mUst secUre a bit of shUteye.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: By jove?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh my lord.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoUr lord?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: what...</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: do yoU mean by that exactly? :u</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nothin'.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Hang on, though. Before you go,</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You never did give me any actual advice on my situation.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: With the dead agent, and my blown cover.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh, right!</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i woUld look at it this way.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU are moments away from beginning yoUr session, yes?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sure.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and yoU have already spent a long time gathering intelligence Unbeknownst to the aUthorities.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: how mUch more do yoU expect to accUmUlate even if yoU coUld stay Undetected?</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and how mUch strategic advantage is left to gain by delaying yoUr discovery for mUch longer?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i say the time to make a stand is now!</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: to hell with the dersite tossers.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: make yoUr presence known. let them see that the prince is awake, and make it abUndantly clear what that means.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: perhaps it is their tUrn to be nervoUs? to cower in the shadows and live in Uncertainty?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Hmm.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that is my advice. do with it as yoU will.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now i'm off to get some rest. u_u</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: with any lUck, the next time we convene, both of oUr adventUres will be well Under way.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: cheerio!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You know, I'm not sure anyone ever actually says cheerio.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">uranianUmbra [UU]</span> ceased cheering <span style="color: #f2a400">timaeusTestified [TT]</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Unless they're pretending to be British.</span>
