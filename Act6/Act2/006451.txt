<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Insane stunts are practically all I'm all about.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: As long as I actually AGREE with the purpose they're intended to serve.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Destroying Jane's computer and dissuading her from playing is not such a purpose.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: betcha ur responder would agree w me</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I kind of wish you wouldn't do that with him.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why the f not</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It just seems a little tawdry and disrespectful.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And vaguely exploitative of a still-emergent cognitive entity, whose perceptional frame of reference is difficult for us to comprehend.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: oh come on</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hes cool a guy just liek you its just he lives in some shades</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It rubs me the wrong way, is all.</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: zzz muh</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: youre over blowin this</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its just an ironic funny thing we do some times</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: come on im sure you read the transcripts urself</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its all alot of jokestery buiishit</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He blocks me from being able to read transcripts sometimes.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: oh</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wow he does?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: sneaky bastart</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And anyway, I'm really not sure how ironic it is.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok next time i will run it by the MASTAR first</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: with his fancy fuckin ironimeter</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, here's the thing with the AR, since you still don't seem to get it.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He's very similar to me in thought process and behavior, yes.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But those patterns were imported from a thirteen year old version of my psyche, and then sealed into the program as starting parameters.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In the years since, we've both evolved somewhat. I, as humans tend to, and he, in whatever way is natural for a frequently running, self-aware application.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So if there are differences between us, they're first reflected by what I feel is a maturity gap, and then further by several years of minor behavioral divergences.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: omg...</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hes 13yo dirk</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why did than not occur to me that is so cute</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and makes me feel kinda skeevy 4 sayin anything lascivious @ him</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: dammit you ruin everything!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're welcome.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yo, you guys realize I can hear you, right?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: pfffffhahaha</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes, I was aware.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Check out all these complicated fucking problems people have when they have to live in big lumbering fleshmonsters instead of a sweet pair of shades.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dude, do you think you could sit this one out for a while? This conversation practically doesn't even concern you at this point.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It seems there is some gnarly crooked number that represents the percentage of probability you just said this doesn't concern me.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Even though it's patently obvious that half the conversation, like, way totally concerns me.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Shit, Roxy look. He's doing the thing where he ironically pretends to fail the Turing test to sass me into submission.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Even though I was the one who fucking programmed him to do that.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ell</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: emm</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: eff</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ayy</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: OFF~~!~</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like my butt is juts there on the floor</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: is how hard i elled it off just now</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: (Not peekin' at the floor butt cause I'm only 13 years old, motherfuckers.)</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This is fuckin' dumb.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm going to leave both of you to interact however you want. I have important shit to deal with and actual responsibilities to take seriously.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Roxy, go nap off your drink, or aggressively wage another flirtlarping campaign, whatever, I don't care.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just don't send that file to Jane, ok?</span>
