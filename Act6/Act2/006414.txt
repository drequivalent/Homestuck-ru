<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok well since youre so nice</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ill promoise not to use my wicked void powers re: basic common sense + skills of deduction to bust you up so bad</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i'd be ever so gratefUl. :u</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: then w.o givin you the whole 3rd degree</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what is safe to tell me?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like what does it mean to be a rogue of void</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: thats what i am rite</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes! i can tell yoU plenty aboUt that.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a rogUe is a passive class. yoU see, there are passive (+) and active (-) classes. some more strongly passive or active than others.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the +/- distinction can mean many things, bUt coUld be qUite roUghly sUmmed Up in this way: active classes exploit their aspect to benefit themselves, while passive classes allow their aspect to benefit others.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt of coUrse there's plenty more to it, and that rUle is in no way absolUte. only a starting point for Understanding the dichotomy.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you mean kinda like</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: offensive vs defesive magic in an rpg</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: sUre!</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that's another fine way of looking at it.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: classes always come in +/- pairs, with significant disparity between them.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: while a rogUe is passive, a thief woUld be its far more active coUnterpart.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the rogUe and thief classes tend to be assigned to females. not exclUsively, bUt commonly!</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: other classes lean more toward male assignment, while others are exclUsively male, and jUst as many are exclUsively female. like my class. ^u^</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that's a bit of a tangent thoUgh. to answer yoUr qUestion aboUt being a rogUe, i shoUld tell yoU both classes in +/- pairs tend to have very similar descriptions.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: in this case, a rogUe or a thief is &quot;one who steals.&quot; qUite simple, really!</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt whether the class is + or - makes all the difference. it is a great indicator as to how a hero will make Use of the aspect.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so basically</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: a thief is like the asshole class</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the player who says step off shits mine suckas</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: whereas</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: a rogue</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: is bascially robin hood</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if that reference to yoUr cUltUre provides a sUitable comparison, then absolUtely. :U</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so im essantially the robin hood of void</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: im still not sure</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wtf that actually means</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: Understandable.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i guess robin hods p cool tho</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: thiefin up loot from peeps who got too much</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: then all sugardaddyin it out 2 the needy like a boss</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just dont have a clue how that works with void</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes, it is one of the more conceptUally nebUloUs pairings, i agree.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and i can't say i know a smashing good deal aboUt the natUre of the void player's path, since the aspect is by definition inscrUtable to those it does not choose.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i can at least tell yoU this.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if yoU are ever to enjoy fUll ascension as a rogUe of void, yoU will be able to do some completely astonishing things!</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like what</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh no, yoU will not pry this oUt of me.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: not to preserve caUsality, bUt to keep the sUrprise in store for yoU.</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it woUld not be honoUrable of me to spoil the discovery, shoUld yoU be fortUnate enoUgh to realize yoUr potential.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: well</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: about that</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i feel sorta stupid about this but</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ive been giving all my friends this whole dramagic spiel about not wanting to even play this thing</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and i might of fucked stuff up already</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: is that so?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its so</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and i guess i still havnt decide what to do</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: there are props and cons 2 both things</span>
<span style="color: #929292">UU: woUld yoU mind listing them?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok either i dont play</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and i get this kinda passive aggressive revange at the witch for killing my mom</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and thereafter keep staying here and being lonely</span>
