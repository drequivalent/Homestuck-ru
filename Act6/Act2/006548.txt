<span style="color: #323232">uu: OF COuRSE I'M GOING TO PLAY. I WAS JuST SAYING I WOuLDN'T. YOu KNOW. TO FuCK WITH HER AND MAKE HER CRY.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: LIKE I HAVE A CHOICE. BuT TO PLAY.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: HOW ELSE AM I GOING TO GET OFF THIS DESOLATE ROCK?</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: YOu THINK I WANT TO STAY HERE? JuST HANG AROuND. TIL I JOIN THE HuNDRED BILLION CORPSES FERTILIZING THE SOIL?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I see.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, didn't think so. I was just curious.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: HuMAN CuRIOSITY IS CONTEMPTIBLE. SHE SHARES THAT WITH YOu. AND I CAN'T FuCKING STAND IT.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Gotcha.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You sure seem to hate us, but I notice it doesn't stop you from talking to us frequently. Or at least to me.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Surely there must be at least one of our virtues you admire.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: YES. AMBITION. THAT'S THE ONLY GOOD ONE.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: AND I THINK YOu GOT THAT. WHICH IS MAYBE WHY. YOu'RE THE ONLY ONE I CAN PuT uP WITH FOR ANY DuRATION?</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: LET'S CALL IT A GRuDGING RESPECT. WHICH IS THE ONLY KIND THAT'S EVEN WORTH A FuCK.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'll take that as a rare overture of friendship.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: NO. DON'T.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So, do you even know how this is going to work?</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: WHAT.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Your session. Can you even really have a session with only two players?</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: SHE SAYS YOu CAN. AND SHE LIKES TO THINK SHE'S THE EXPERT.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: PERSONALLY? I DON'T CARE.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: MAYBE IT'S AGAINST THE RuLES. WHAT WE'RE DOING.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: I JuST WANT TO GET IN THERE. AND JuST.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: FuCK.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: SHIT.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I sensed that was your plan.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which is kind of what I'm talking about. How can you win like that?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I thought the point was to cooperate with your coplayers to achieve an objective.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not compete with them or try to kill them. I don't think we've had one conversation where you didn't express the desire to kill her.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: I GuESS WE'LL JuST HAVE TO SEE. WON'T WE?</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY A DIFFERENT KIND OF SESSION.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: ONE WHERE THE PLAYERS FIGHT FOR SuPREMACY. RATHER THAN WORK TOGETHER.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: I THINK THAT IT MuST BE THAT WAY.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: BECAuSE THAT IS HOW I WANT IT TO BE.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: AND IF I WANT SOMETHING TO BE TRuE HARD ENOuGH. THEN THAT MAKES IT SLIGHTLY MORE ABSOLuTELY IRREFuTABLE.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: ARE YOu FEELING ME, FuCKER?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe you're right.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But since that's how you feel now, maybe the truth is that the game is challenging you to overcome those feelings?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What if your real quest is to put aside your differences and work together, if you want to both survive, and grow as a person?</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: NO.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: NO. NO. NO.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: FuCK THAT SHIT.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, I didn't think you'd dig that idea.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just puttin' it out there.</span>
<span style="color: #323232">uu: HOW ABOuT YOu SHuT uP? AND GET ON THE ROOF. AND TAKE YOuR FuCKING PuNISHMENT.</span>
