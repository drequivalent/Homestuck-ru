<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Now do me a favor and hop off the couch.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ok.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What are you doing?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Makin' room for something big.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: So you're going through with it then?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Today is the day?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's not that simple.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's a very dynamic situation with many moving parts, and I'm waiting for it to unfold.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If the right opportunity presents itself, yes, I could envision myself taking action.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Dynamic situation with many moving parts?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That's the shittiest erotic excerpt I ever read.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Which one of us was supposed to be the robot again?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Shut up.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I think you're being coy with me.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Don't you?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not really.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It seems there is a 3.14159...4% chance you aren't being coy with me. Are you being coy with me, Dirk?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I am seriously going to go into your program and remove that particular speech pattern from your routines.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It stopped being funny about two seconds after I coded it.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The compiler even flagged it with a warning.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: &quot;WARNING ON LINE WHATEVER: Dirk, this isn't fucking funny.&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I think you have this whole blueprint in your head about how it's all supposed to go.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He acts as your server player and brings you into the session.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Then later he joins the game.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Maybe he finds himself a bit overwhelmed by it all.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: No extra lives left or anything. Suddenly he's backed into a corner, surrounded by monsters and out of ammo. SUBSTANTIAL vulnerabilities up in here. The kind that make a guy question what he believes about himself.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: When who shows up to save him? None other than his dashing client player, +1 bitchin' pair of shades that'll have the best seat in the house when the fireworks go off.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Wait, whose fantasy were we talking about again?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Your gutterball was so rowdy it catapulted into the adjacent lane.</span>
