<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: hay look</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: its jake stuffed in a blue windsock</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: heheheh</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: huh?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: n/m</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: so what kind of hot god tier trix can you teach me</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: tricks...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess i don't know any actual TRICKS per se, aside from how to use some of my powers.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i don't know if the same tricks apply to using your powers...</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: u said u could help tho</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i said MAYBE i could!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i dunno, i was just throwing it out there.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: like, maybe if i told you about some of the experiences i had when i was learning to do my windy stuff, you might have some kind of... voidey epiphany?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: a voidey epiphany</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: k then</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: im all ears johnny windsock</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: let loose ur wisdom whilst i rake in the epiphanies</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, um,</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i've noticed whenever i learn to do new things with my powers, it's usually in response to something. like something important that has to be done.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so why are you trying to make this spike ball?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and how important does it feel to you?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: well at first i was mainly tryin to make it because dog girl was forcing me to</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but now i think i keep trying because im gettin obsessed with making this dumb spikeball and PO'd that i cant do it</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i see.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what actually IS this spike ball, if you don't mind my asking?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: its an alien egg</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: 4 tha trolls</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: to hatch em all back to life</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but only to be ruled by an evil witch so its gonna be shitty for them</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: so yeah its kind of an important thing</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but at the same time it would probably be terrible if i actually made it so...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: then maybe the fact that you're conflicted about it is why you're having trouble?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: yeh maybe</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: if you think it's important to make, but don't want to give it to the bad guys, why don't you just...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: break out of jail?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: then you could try to make the egg at your own discretion, and use it however you think is best.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: idk</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i broke outta here once already and the fuckin witch just nabbed me again</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: and that was BEFORE she recruited jakes omnipotent goofball grandma to zap me back here the moment i step outside</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah. it is a tricky situation with grimbark jade on the loose, that's for sure.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i've been managing to evade her.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i just swoosh the breeze around to hide my scent, and dissolve into wind and fly away if she finds me.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: maybe you could do something like that too?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it seems to me if anyone should be able to avoid detection using their powers, it would be a void player.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: get it? a void... as in, avoid?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: heh.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: that is legit sound reasoning yo</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: + a way lame pun 2 boot</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but remember how we were just talkin about the fact that when it comes to god tier shit i dont know what the eff im doin??</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: right.</span>
