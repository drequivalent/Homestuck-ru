<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> But why, lord bro</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I was just about to pony up the boob fa%</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> There is a 100% probability that you would have been thrilled to hear my e%egesis on troll knockers</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: It might have been an interesting subject to talk about another time, with a different person.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: But that's not now, and it sure isn't with you.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Dude, that is ice cold</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I would be hurt, if I were not a flawless machine fused with haughty nobility</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> If you don't wish to hear my epic monodialogue on alien bazongas</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I'm not sure what else I can do to entertain you</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> You are seriously hoofcuffing my material here</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Pretty demanding, if you ask me</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> But as your mystical guide, I suppose it is my duty to manufacture small talk, if that's what you really want</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> What about fine art? We could talk about that</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Dirk, did you know the sweaty troll guy who I used to be, and still kind of am, used to adore fine art?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> He was just like you and me, in that sense</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> It seems I have a lot in common with myself</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> If you can ever manage to get over yourself, I would highly recommend being me</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Or at least something like me</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Maybe somewhere, there is a dead troll out there, just waiting for you to merge with him</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: I wasn't asking you to make small talk, or to hear about all the ways you've managed to shit around wasting time.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Believe it or not, I was hoping you would describe the tactical situation there.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Sounds boring</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Are you sure you don't want to talk about paintings of big naked horse monsters and such?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Yes, you got me.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: I would love to have a long talk about horse nudes and xenobreasts with you.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Unfortunately I'm wearing pantaloons and flying through the middle of goddamn nowhere.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Pantaloons you say</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Pant a fucking loons.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Sir, are you implying that you are not dressed appropriately for a discussion of high culture</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Because it seems to me that you could not be dressed more appropriately if you tried</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: I respectfully disagree.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Where are you?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: I don't know. Way out in space.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: I'm flying back there now.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> How long do you suppose it will take you to get back?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: I'm not sure.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: A pretty good while.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Never mind. I have triangulated your location and velocity using long range sensor technology, and probably also some sprite magic</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: You did?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Hey Dirk</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Remember how whenever I dubiously claimed to have triangulated something, it was always this great play on words?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Not really.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Because I was just a pair of triangles</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> But not anymore</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: I know.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Because I have this rockin' new torso</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Cool.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: How long do your calculations say it will take me to get back?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> E%actly a little more than three hours</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Damn it.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Additional sweeps from my STRONGLASERS are telling me there are a few other people on the periphery of the session closing in at a similar rate</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Who?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Just some dudes</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> What are you doing all the way out there and wearing pantaloons, by the way</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Let's not talk about the pantaloons anymore.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Roxy and I became god tiers, but I don't remember exactly how.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Then I saw the Batterwitch.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: So I charged her with my sword, so as to ruin her shit.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: That's when some crazy wolf girl appeared and punched me in the face.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Then I think she teleported me out here.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> That was evil Jade</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Evil Jade??</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yes</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: You mean Jake's grandmother.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yes</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: She's evil too?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yes</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Is anyone there NOT evil?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yes</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Yes what?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yes anyone here is not evil</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> That is to say, there e%ist people here who are not evil</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Such as Dave</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Dave is not evil, to my knowledge</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Dave???</span>
