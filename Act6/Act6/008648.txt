<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: you sure</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It's em8arrassing!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I cringe every time I think a8out her self-indulgent exploits.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: mhm</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Doesn't she realize this sort of thing never works?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You don't just go and insert yourself into the middle of all the action in the most hamfisted way possi8le just 8ecause you can't stand another second 8eing out of the spotlight.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: That always goes horri8ly for everyone.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Even worse, it ends up making you look like an idiot.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: And even MORE worse, it's making ME look like an idiot 8y associ8tion!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Why couldn't she have thought this through a little more?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Why couldn't she have at least TOLD us first?</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: shruggin ma shoulders yo</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: How is it that I understand this and she doesn't?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: She's HOW much older than me?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Like a 8ajillion dream 8u88le sweeps or something?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: All that experience and wisdom, and she's out there floundering around like fucking noo8.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: (floundering)</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It's so disheartening. She wants to 8e like Marquise so much, just like I used to.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut she is NOTHING like her!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You kind of need to have a fuck ton of experience doing, you know... a lot of ruthless pir8tey shit 8efore you can pull that off?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You can't just 8e a 8ookish dwee8 all your life, then suddenly decide to flip the 8adass switch and expect people to take you seriously.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Also, to truly pull that off, it MIGHT help to actually 8e a goddamned adult.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I know, I must 8e totally off my swaychair for suggesting it. 8ut may8e, just MAY8E, there are certain roles and 8ehaviors which are 8est left to fully developed, grown ass people!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Not to sound like a wet 8lanket, 8ut my ancestor's journal contained some EXTREMELY mature content!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: So now we have yet another stupid kid trying to fill the 8oots of a legendary pir8 queen, and it's amateur hour all over again.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: All I can see in her is me when I used to........</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: And it makes me want to........</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: UGHHHHHHHH!</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: stop movin around all angry</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: you fuckin me up here</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Sorry.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I'm just dismayed 8y some of the implic8tions of her actions.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Is this really how I came off when I used to pull this sort of shit?</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: dunno wasnt there</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I have a sickening feeling it was just like this.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: No wonder no8ody could stand me.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: And here I am, 8itching at my ancestor like I know 8etter, like I've evolved 8eyond all that.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut........</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Have I really?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Do I go around thinking I'm smarter than I used to 8e, 8ut end up repeating all the same old patterns without even realizing it?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Was the plan to find this treasure and 8uild an army just a rest8tement of my immature, egomaniacal 8ullshit disguised as a more &quot;strategically sensi8le&quot; plan?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: If I can apparently keep kidding myself a8out this crap forever, then how would I know the difference?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I guess the thing I h8 most a8out her stunt isn't that it's a dum8 plan, or that we weren't included.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It's that it's making me wonder if I can trust any of my own judgments, even after all this time.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: thats some baller inward reflection serk</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I don't know a8out that.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: If it's so 8aller, why is it making me feel like shit?</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: thats what its supposed to do i think</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: but like</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: tempurarily?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I guess.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: What a8out you?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Does any of this reson8 at all?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I know you used to stir up shit with your friends.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You must have done some outrageous things which you thought were necessary for the good of the team. When you look 8ack, do you ever wonder what you were thinking? Or if you every truly evolved?</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: na</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Oh, come on.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Don't leave me hanging in self dou8t lim8o here.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Gimme SOMETHING, Peixes.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: haha</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i dont know maybe??</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: sea my thing is</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i dont verbally torture my cray schemes like all the serket girls</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: and that works ok for me</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: guess i made some mistakes but who really gives a flip</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You don't care if you make mistakes?</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: not like you and she do</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: araneas deal is</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: what shes doin now isnt much different from how she always did stuff</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: the stuff she does is never about the things shes actually doing</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: its about what those things M-EAN and makin sure everyone KNOWS what they mean</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: and above all makin sure everyone understands how important she is cause shes obviously the source of all that critical M-EANING without which all action would be pointless right?</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: but thats not how i rolled</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i just</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: did shit</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: and the shit i did</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: meant only the things the shit accomplished</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: and if that shit accomplished a dumb thing that sucked</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: then i guess thats what you call a mistake and oh fuckin well</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: mistakes aint make me feel too bad since i dont really connect results with my shelf worth</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: ya feel me</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: YES.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: That is so right on.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: If you asked me a long time ago, I'm sure I would have insisted that's exactly how I felt a8out everything I did too.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut I don't know if that's true anymore.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: In fact, I'm sure that WASN'T true.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I was always invested as hell in the consequences of everything I did, and how it made me look.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: And how it made me feel a8out myself especially.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: ok i will admit</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i always felt hella bad about decisions leavin me with less gold</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: glub damn</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: feel a tide a shame wash over me just thinkin about going broke</span>
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Well of course.</span>
