<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: your mom?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well, yeah. but i know her as your daughter.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i mean, who the hell knows at this point?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i know rite</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: the curious case of the mutual moms</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: it is</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: the biggest mystery?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: u no</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: once i even caught wind of some lore that implied i might even be my OWN mom</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: (fefeta hinted that @ me once during a long spiel DAMN that girl could talk)</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: how messed up would that be tho</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: there is probably something to that actually.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you were all the first batch of babies, after all.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i think you were literal copies of yourselves?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that's what it supposedly means to be a paradox clone.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: babies</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: wat</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess i kind of glossed over this stuff in my story.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i was the one who made us all in the first place, with a weird cloning machine.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: no fuckin shit???</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: *is impressed*</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it was no big deal though. i was just messing around with a control panel, and some babies appeared.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: so we already met huh</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: and i dont even remember because i was just some idiot bb</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: that aint fair!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: come to think of it, we met one other time too.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but you were asleep.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: ??</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you were floating around in purple pajamas, and i pushed you out of the way of a flying fork.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i almost forgot about that. but yep, that was you alright.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: you shoulda woke me up then</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i might have, but the fork stabbed me in the chest, and dream killed my sleep ghost. or something.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you know how it is with dream logic.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: u mean how it makes lil 2 no sense ever</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes, exactly.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess i didn't think much about it at the time, but i had a sneaky suspicion that's who you were.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you really look a lot like rose.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she is looking for you, by the way.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: yeah?????</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she told me to go find you. and i did.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so, she says hi.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: o man</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: what else did she say</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: uh.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she said...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she's looking forward to meeting you?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: awwwwww</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: well if u see her again before i do tell her i cant wait to meet her too</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: though tbh im kinda nervous about it but dont tell her that part haha</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: sure!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: there's nothing to be nervous about though.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she's just a nice nerd who likes to read and knit.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i shouldnt be surprised to hear that</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: me and all my friends are a bunch of silly nerds too</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: even dirk who thinks hes 2 cool 4 school</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: when in reality he is nowhere close to clearing the coolness threshold which exempts one from attending an educational institution :p</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: speaking of which...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i've been wondering where he is?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i know jade's grandpa is in jail too, getting badgered by my evil nanna...</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: u mean jake n jane</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes, sorry.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i have not seen hide nor hair of dave's bro yet.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i figured he got thrown in jail too</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: although come to think of it i probly would have heard a bloody ruckus by now resulting from his inevitable escape attempt</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: hmm.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: im not that worried about him though hes good at takin care of himself</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: in fact i feel like all of us will be ok now that you guys are here</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: there is still one of my friends im worried about the most</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: who?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: shes my best friend</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: well ok</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i got a few best friends u know?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but she was always kind of a special best friend</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: and last time i saw her she was in big trouble</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh no.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: where is she?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: in the afterlife</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: being dead</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ...</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: her bro killed her</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: which is bad enough</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but now hes out there</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: hunting for her ghost</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: shes doing her best to hide</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but her bro is an awful and relentless piece of shit and im afraid</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: im afraid she might be already gone :(</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you're right, that is very concerning.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: who is she? would i know of her?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: dunno</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: how in the loop are you on cherubs?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: surprisingly, i know a LOT about that subject.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: for instance, did you know they turn into gigantic snakes when they have sex?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: :O</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: :O</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: :O</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i know. weird, right?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that's probably not very relevant to the topic at hand, though.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: yeah prob not</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: anyway u know about lord english right</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: uh huh.</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: shes his sister</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: her name is calliope</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ohhh.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, this is starting to make sense.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: yep</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: shes supposed to be critical to defeatin him somehow</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: shes going on some quest out there to find a deadlier version of herself or whatever</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i dunno that could be all be true...</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: and maybe its selfish of me but all i rly care about now is if shes ok??</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i understand. she is your friend.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i would feel the same way.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: :)</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: wait a minute...</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i have such a good idea that would solve your problem.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: ????</span>
