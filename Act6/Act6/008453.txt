<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I do like to wear jewelry from time to time, just like you.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It's certainly possi8le there is a shiny new ring on my finger.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: So what if there is?</span>

<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: throw it in a volcano or somefin and just come home</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: First, I would appreci8 it if you referred to me as Mindfang.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Remem8er how I've 8een trying to make that 8e a thing l8tely?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Second, I have no intention of discarding this ring, now or ever.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Wheels are already in motion, Meenah.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Irons are heating up as we speak!</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: wheels</span>

<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I am just taking some initi8tive for a change.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Has it occurred to you that it might have 8ecome a little tiresome for me to spend eternity as a 8oring no8ody while so many others got to play important roles in determining the f8 of reality?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Heck, you were 8arely dead for two minutes 8efore you started assem8ling an army!</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Even my altern8 universe self got to lead an amazing life. Which is all well and good for HER........</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut what a8out ME, Meenah?</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Water. 8oat. <span style="font-style: italic">Me.</span></span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: yo i feel you on that</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: trust me gurl</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: but you do realize youre makin a glubbin mess here</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i mean you KNOW this shit aint like</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: part a the legit chain of events</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: you arent supposed to be there</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Of course I know that.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Like I said, I have a plan.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: W)(AT PLAN</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I'm going to take over this session.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And then I am going to make sure it never 8ears fruit.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: If I can stop this universe from 8eing cre8ted, then the young Lord of Time will never have hatched in the first place.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I won't merely 8e defeating an invinci8le foe. I will 8e erasing all the pain he has ever caused.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: uh</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: serk have you lost it</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: you know all youre doing is making another doomed timeline where everyone dies right</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Of course I know that.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Please, Meenah. Don't insult me. I've given this a lot of thought.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: If anyone else attempted this, what you said would 8e true. 8ut I am not just anyone.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I am a very powerful Sylph of Light. I have had millions of sweeps to hone my a8ilities.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: As one gifted with the aspect of light, certain outcomes will 8e prone to 8r8king in my favor.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And as an ancient, highly experienced sylph, I wield an unprecedented a8ility to heal.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: A doomed timeline is really just an anatomical feature of a much larger organism. Like a capillary which comes to an end, 8ecause it has withered and died.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I 8elieve I will 8e a8le to heal this offshoot.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And with enough time and patience, I am confident I can restore its vitality to such a gr8 extent, it will effectively take over as the alpha timeline, thus reducing English to a lost footnote of paradox space.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Then the new alpha timeline will flourish under my immortal care. I will watch over it for eternity, assuring peace and harmony everywhere. There will 8e a new progeny of universes, and those universes will 8eget more universes, and each will 8enefit from my good grace. I will personally make sure nothing like the English mishap ever occurs again.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I mean, this is mostly theoretical, of course.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut the most important thing here is that I am involved now.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It is vital to all our interests that I at least TRY. </span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: aight</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: so you just totally flipped your think pan is all</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: got it</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I appreci8 the vote of confidence.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Are we a8out done here?</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: no</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: so your timeline healing fantasy aside</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: your plan is to just waltz in there</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: an knock over the whole session</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: you do realize that means youll have to take down my grownup self</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: like</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: not to blow my own conch but she is arguably the greatest deadliest most stylin badass who ever lived</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I am aware.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut there is no one who is in a 8etter position to deal with her than myself.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: After all, who knows you 8etter than I? ::::)</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: ok yeah but</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: you aint exactly shoppin for her mindfang</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: she got all these sick powers yo</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It's like I said.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I've had quite a long time to refine my a8ilities.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I will have a few tricks up my sleeve.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: man</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: this is gonna go so terribubbly</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Meenah, I must say your attitude is a little surprising.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I thought you were typically gung ho a8out such audacious escapades?</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: yeah well</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: theres audacious and then theres bald faced flipping insmanatee</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: beside</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: did you ever stop and think about me</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: What a8out you?</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: you being alive again</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: all runnin around stirring up trouble while im still a ghost</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: im gonna miss you</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I'll miss you too, Meenah.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: will i ever sea you again</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I really don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: When you're trying to do the right thing, there is always sacrifice involved.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Remem8er? That's why we all died in the first place.</span>
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i guess</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8esides. I'm sure Vriska would approve of my plan.</span>
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: May8e she can explain my reasoning 8etter than I have.</span>
