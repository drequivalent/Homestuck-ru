The cool Flash animation is unexpectedly cut short due a critical stardust clog. What a shame. Those exciting new gameplay features were looking real slick, too. You think it was pretty neat how the panels were sliding around like that. Oh well, you probably didn't miss all that much. 

Nevertheless, on a hunch you navigate once again to your trusty <a href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/colours-and-mayhem-universe-a" target="_blank" class="postlink">bandcamp page</a>, and check the length of the song in question. Your fears are confirmed. It seems you missed four solid minutes of footage. You wonder if you'll ever find out what happened? 

You decide to click on the planets above to try to make some sense of the situation.
