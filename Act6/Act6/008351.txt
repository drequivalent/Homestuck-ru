<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it seems like you have me at a disadvantage then.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: which is impressive, considering you are in jail, and also in a little green pyramid thingy for some reason.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: did you...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: did you actually build that thing?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: f yeah!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that's cool. it's like a little fort.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i built a fort once in my room. i made it out of a bed sheet, and some cruxite dowels.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: then my friend threw it in a bottomless pit.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: hahah</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: thas awesome</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it was alright.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i wouldn't dare.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: aren't you going to come out so i can see you?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i would but</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: ive been tryin to concentrate on something</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: so i built this sick pyramid deal to help focus my brain chi and spiritual majyyks and if at all possible to blitz my chakras out the yin yang</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: is it working?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: no</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but at least its nice and dark and quiet in here and free of distactions</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: or it was until a guy came along lookin for some chick</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what are you trying to do exactly?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i have to make a spikeball appear out of thin air</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but all i can make are these lame cubes</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you made all these cubes??</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: yup</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that's a neat power.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: ty</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i also made some pumpkins</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: cubes n pumpkins</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: the manifestations of amateurs</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: theyre basically freebies for void players i think</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i remember making some of those cubes with my alchemiter.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i think that's what a blank card makes? so yeah, they're super primitive.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but making pumpkins is pretty impressive. they're like... these big ol' vegetables.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: no dude</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: pumpkins are helllls o primitive</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: voidwise theyre like the middle square on a bingo card</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: drummin up a dumb gourd aint nothing to write home about</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well, if you're really having trouble...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i know a thing or two about learning to use god tier powers.</span>
