<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: spent way too long wallowing in our own filth on that gnarly meteor thats for sure</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: this doesnt even seem like my room anymore</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: its like trespassing or something like im horning in on somebody elses life</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: a life lived most sweetly though i will admit</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: ahahaha the fuckin toilets still there</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: i remember when jade put that there that is perhaps like my favorite memory</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: ill just keep shufflin thru memory lane making wistful observations out loud</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: you know it kinda chaps my bulge that people rip on me for talking to myself</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: its like the most perfectly natural thing to do</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: why are people so up tight about keepin a lid on their monologues what a bunch of stuffy pricks</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: ive always found the sound of my own voice to be mysteriously soothing</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: haha talk about an embarrassing sentence to say in earshot of an actual person</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: well maybe not the mayor</span>
