<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: I've tried to get in touch with others to no avail.</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: No answer from Jake or Roxy.</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: And Jane responded only with &quot;CEASE REPRODUCTION&quot; in red letters, whatever that means. Then she blocked me.</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: I'm afraid she might have snapped.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yes, isn't it great?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I mean, aside from the fact that she is insane and evil</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: Huh?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> She is one of the few organic beings who will ever realize perfe%ion</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Miss Crocker is now a vessel for a cunning, malicious artificial intelligence whose neural netroni% and ontology buffers and stuff like that have somehow managed to far surpass even my own</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Clearly she has procured ma%imum advantage from her apprenticeship under me, although I must admit not even I in all my hypercognitive percipience was quite aware that said tutelage was even taking place</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> One must inviolably deduce via tons of math that this is because I am just that clopdarned STRONG at mentoring, even on an involuntary basis</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I am so proud of her</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: Ok, all that bullshit aside,</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: What's this about her becoming evil?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> The thing about Jane becoming evil is</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> In the process of achieving perfe%ion...</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> It seems there is a ludi%ly high probability that she has become evil</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Does that answer your question?</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: No.</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: How is becoming evil achieving perfection?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Admittedly it is a blemish</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> But only a very small one</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Her imperfect meatmind has been fully fiddling hijacked by a supercomputer and that is the operative transmutation here</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> To such e%ceptional beings of class and breeding as she and I, considerations of morality and alignment are trifling details</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: Why.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Why what</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: Why do I keep going along with these &quot;ironic AI&quot; conversations.</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: They've gotten even worse now that you're half creepy troll.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Sir brah, listen</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Here is a comparison that your dreary, finite wad of gray matter might be able to process</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Like, say you've got a <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arspritetxt_bitch.gif" border="0" />in' bod. You are a paragon of physical e%cellence</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> You could then either be oiled up, or not. See what I mean, good dude?</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: No.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> You could fle% your brawn while wearing either a sweaty pair of briefs, or a snug human banana hammock</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Such minutia does not change the fact that you're a tiptop beefcake ma%ed out buffways</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: I hate everything you have to say about all topics.</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: Especially muscles.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> The stuff I have cited which are commonly associated with your/our Earth bodybuilders are but picayune technicalities, just as considerations of good and evil are to aristocratic se%y cybergods such as myself and our imperial heiress, of whom neither you nor I are particularly worthy</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Are you following any of this, Vitamin D?</span>
<span style="color: #ffcc00">DIRK: Can you just tell me what's going on over there?</span>
