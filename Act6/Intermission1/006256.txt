<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: I Would Function As A Premium Escort To The Load Gaper And Thats About It</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: but kanaya you still have important work to finish too!</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: we cant ignore our duties</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: What Are You Talking About</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: our race is extinct remember</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: and after a few more casualties it is now hanging by a thread</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: your job was to see to the resurrection of our people</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: What Real Hope Is There For That</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: The Orb Was Destroyed</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: I Was Never Able To Duplicate It The Grist Cost Was Astronomical</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: theres always hope though!</span>

<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Doesnt Rose Know</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Cant You See The Path To Victory On This Matter</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It's hard to say.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Does the repopulation of your species qualify as victory?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: These things aren't always clear cut. Some outcomes are for your own judgment.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: What outcome would you like the most?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: I Would Like To Have The Orb Again And To Keep It Safe This Time</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: And I Guess To Not Be A Total Failure</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Ok.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: If you follow my advice, I can at least promise you will find yourself in the best position to determine whether that may come to pass.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: ...</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Can you please come?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Between the two of us, you with your inexplicably heretofore unmentioned phosphorescence, and I with my nigh-reflective traffic cone orange sun-sari, the meteor should never be <span style="font-style: italic">too</span> dark.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: (sollux, oh my god is it me or is everybody already just fucking hitting on each other left and right? oh god i can't take sweeps of this shit, don't leave me alone here, please don't)</span>

<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Well</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: All Right</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: But Must We Really Leave So Soon</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It's soon or never. But not immediately.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Even if the route were accessible right now, it would still behoove us to wait.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: There's correspondence from John yet to arrive.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: whoa really</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: And after that, we have to wait for one final guest to appear.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Then we ride like the solar wind. The race will be afoot.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Wait Another Visitor</span>
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Who</span>
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: FUCK!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Oh lord.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Now what?</span>
