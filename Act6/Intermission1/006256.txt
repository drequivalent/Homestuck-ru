<span style="color: #a10000">АРАДИЯ: and after a few more casualties it is now hanging by a thread</span>

<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: Cant You See The Path To Victory On This Matter</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: It's hard to say.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Does the repopulation of your species qualify as victory?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: These things aren't always clear cut. Some outcomes are for your own judgment.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: What outcome would you like the most?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: I Would Like To Have The Orb Again And To Keep It Safe This Time</span>
<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: And I Guess To Not Be A Total Failure</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Ok.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: If you follow my advice, I can at least promise you will find yourself in the best position to determine whether that may come to pass.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: ...</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Can you please come?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Between the two of us, you with your inexplicably heretofore unmentioned phosphorescence, and I with my nigh-reflective traffic cone orange sun-sari, the meteor should never be <span style="font-style: italic">too</span> dark.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: (sollux, oh my god is it me or is everybody already just fucking hitting on each other left and right? oh god i can't take sweeps of this shit, don't leave me alone here, please don't)</span>

<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: All Right</span>
<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: But Must We Really Leave So Soon</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: It's soon or never. But not immediately.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Even if the route were accessible right now, it would still behoove us to wait.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: There's correspondence from John yet to arrive.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: whoa really</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: And after that, we have to wait for one final guest to appear.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Then we ride like the solar wind. The race will be afoot.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: Wait Another Visitor</span>
<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: Who</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: FUCK!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Oh lord.</span>
