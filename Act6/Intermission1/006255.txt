<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Пока ничего.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Но веротно скоро в определённом окне настанет время покинуть это место.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Замем мы будем двигать этот метеорит так быстро, насколько это возможно, строго в определённом направлении.</span>
<span style="color: #a1a100">СОЛЛУКС: куда?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Пока никуда.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Сейчас можно сказать только, что путь лежит через тьму.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: Вижу</span>
<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: Then Perhaps We Should Reserve The Infinite Darkness Plan For The Maybe Column For Now</span>
<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: I Think Im Even Willing To Let Dave Take A Crack At The Logistics Before We Commit To That Particular Maneuver Daring Though It Sounds</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: aw yeah</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: i got sicknasty logistics up my sleeve</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: i just call them stics fyi which is how you know im way savvy about them</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: most of the stics im fine tuning atm involve rap though i should warn you</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: but dave what if that dope as hell plan falls through i can hear you ask</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: plan b</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: involves drawing some shitty cartoons</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">ДЕЙВ: and not giving a fuck about stuff</span>
<span style="color: #008282">ТЕРЕЗИ: &gt;8D</span>
<span style="color: #008282">ТЕРЕЗИ: 1 H3R3BY S3COND TH1S COOL DUD3S R4D1C4L MOT1ON ON GROUNDS OF R1D1CULOUSLY D3C4D3NT 4TT1R3</span>
<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: Yes Im Willing To Humor Elaboration On This Rap Centric Plan And Its Apathy Based Contingencies</span>
<span style="color: #008141">КАНАЙЯ: Even If Its Excessively Stupid</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Trust me, it is.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Just as you should trust me that by the time we leave, if we leave exactly within the designated window and are able to travel at nearly the speed of light, the meteor will trace a route through the Furthest Ring which will topologically resolve as a straight line.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: It will lead us directly to the new session.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: For a brief moment, the sun will be visible from that session.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: And we will be riding the chartreuse coattails of its photons.</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">АРАДИЯ: this is why you all needed an advanced seer!</span>
<span style="color: #a10000">АРАДИЯ: i have become familiar with the ways of the fabric out here but even i couldnt chart a journey that long or complex</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: That's because it's almost impossible to do so voluntarily.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: If we were to head right now in the session's true physical direction, it wouldn't be long before we found ourselves traveling in just the opposite direction.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: This is not even to speak of the chronological peculiarities. After traveling some distance, we could discover we were suddenly tailgating our own meteor from several days ago.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: If we are particularly unfortunate, we might even collide in an intersection of spacetime with a meteor piloted by our future selves.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: And if we looked closely at that meteor before impact, we might notice a very large dent in it, which it originally suffered during the very collision we were about to experience.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: It takes precision and timing to reach your destination out here, and most importantly, the grace of the gods themselves.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: PPPFFUUUUUUUHHHHHHH......... <span style="font-style: italic">WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZE...</span></span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Hm?</span>
<span style="color: #a1a100">СОЛЛУКС: kk, what the fuck?</span>
<span style="color: #a1a100">СОЛЛУКС: were you h0lding your breath that wh0le time?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: YEAH</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: SO?</span>

<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: OK YEAH</span>

<span style="color: #008282">ТЕРЕЗИ: H3 R34LLY 1S &gt;:|</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: ANYWAY, WHATEVER, SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING LALONDE IS</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THIS HORRIBLE ROCK A GOOD WHILE LONGER TO GET TO THIS PARADISE SESSION OR WHATEVER IT IS?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: AND SINCE WE PROBABLY AREN'T GOING TO FORCE СОЛЛУКС'S BULLSHIT &quot;HALF GHOST&quot; OR WHATEVER TO POP HIMSELF AGAIN LIKE A PACKET OF NASTY FETID MUSTARD SO HE CAN SHOOT THIS THING INTO HYPERSPACE...</span>
<span style="color: #a1a100">СОЛЛУКС: hey man, come 0n. not c0ol.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: I'M GUESSING THAT MEANS IT'LL TAKE CONSIDERABLY LONGER TO GET THERE THAN IT DID TO GET HERE?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: I JUST KNEW IT</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: THIS IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE REALIZED</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: WHEN WE FIRST FLED TO THIS METEOR I HAD THIS WEIRD FEELING WE'D WIND UP SPENDING FOREVER AT THIS MISERABLE PLACE, ASSUMING WE ACTUALLY SURVIVED.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO ASK, HOW LONG IS THIS TRIP GOING TO TAKE?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: PROBABLY SOME ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS AMOUNT OF TIME, LIKE THREE LONG MADDENING SWEEPS, RIGHT???</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: WOULDN'T THAT JUST BE SO COSMICALLY CONVENIENT AND PERFECT FOR EVERYBODY! ESPECIALLY FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT PURPOSE OF ALL, MY UNINTERRUPTED CONTINUUM OF PERSONAL AGONY!!!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: THANK YOU, DARK GODS! THANK YOU SO FUCKING MUCH!!! YOU WIN THIS ROUND! YOU WIN ALL THE ROUNDS APPARENTLY!!!!! THERE ARE NO ROUNDS EVEN. THERE'S JUST YOUR SLIMY TENDRILS, OUR NAKED BODIES, AND EPOCHS OF MOLESTATION.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Don't be ridiculous. It won't take nearly that long.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: OH</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: It'll only take about three years.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: OK</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: THAT'S NOT SO BAD I GUESS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: WAIT, HOW LONG ARE YEARS SUPPOSED TO BE AGAIN?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: WAS IT LIKE TWO WEEKS OR SOMETHING?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: Yes, two.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">РОУЗ: And then fifty more.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">КАРКАТ: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.</span>
