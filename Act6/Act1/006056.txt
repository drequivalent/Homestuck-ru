<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I cannot believe you chose to do this today of all days. I should have known better!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Here I am waking up bright and early, waiting all day with my nose pressed against this glass for the mail to come and wondering if you'll ever log on, and all the while you are just getting blind stinking schnocker-bottomed drunk.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: watcha waiting for</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: in the mail</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: is something happening today or something</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: &amp;%#$@!!!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: The alpha!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jeez-Louise, you are hopeless.</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you sure you even want to play this thing</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: u know its just what the batterwitch wants you to do</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Not this again.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: if you want to go ahead and be a chump jane its ur call im just saying</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i know what a chump looks like</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: The &quot;Batterwitch&quot; DOES NOT EXIST!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It is an idiotic urban legend.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: How many times have I explained this? My great, great grandmother who founded the company and is accused of holding this identity would have to be almost two hundred years old if she were still alive today. The idea is such preposterous hogwash it's hardly worth dignifying with a rational response.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: The iconic face of the company isn't even a real person! She was fabricated long ago during the company's fledgling years.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: right</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: as</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you know</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: an alter ego</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: for somethig more sinister</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Such cuckoobird nonsense.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: In any case, I don't understand the nature of this second guessing, besides chalking it up to your unwelcome inebriation.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: We had agreed you would play with me. You sounded excited about it!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Have you even obtained your copy yet??</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: um</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: suuure did</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Through your various technologically crypotgraphic means, I presume?</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hrm. That is a bit puzzling. I thought this software was highly proprietary.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i told you</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: she wants you to play</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wants us all to</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But what doesn't add up about your story is,</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I believe SOMEBODY doesn't want me to play.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: How else do you explain the recent attempts on my life?</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: dunno</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: someone out their wants the stock price to take a hit?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: &quot;there&quot;</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its just more connivings of the witch</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So this hypothetical monstrosity wants me to succeed, but also wants me to die?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Makes a lot of sense!</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wouldnt put it past her</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: makes you feel perpsecuted</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: redoubles your determination to play</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: u advance her plans in whatever incomprehensible way</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: until suddenly you did evrything she needed you to</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: at which point you become craaaaazy expendable yo</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and then</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: she expends you</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like a wad of boondollars on shitty bc merch</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I see. This is sounding less like a crackpot conspiracy theory by the minute!</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so you want it now or what</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hm. It's tempting, and I'm curious as heck to play it.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But the mail should be coming any minute! I've waited this long for it, so I might as well use the official discs addressed to me.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: When it comes, I do hope you'll change your tune.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Not to mention brew yourself a pot of coffee and sober your drunk butt up.</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: my drunk butts tune will stay as unchanged as it will remain un not drunk</span>
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: makr my barley corerent words</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hoo hoo! Ok, fair enough.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But I believe that when we start playing together, you'll come around.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Personally, I can hardly contain my excitement over it.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: If years ago someone told me, which incidentally someone DID, that today I would have an exclusive opportunity to play what is absolutely the most cutting edge immersive simulation game ever released, developed by a company which has already done so much for the advancement of humanity, I would have said, &quot;Shucks, buster, sign me up!&quot;</span>
