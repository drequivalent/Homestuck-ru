<span style="color: #1f9400">golgothasTerror [GT]</span> began pestering <span style="color: #f2a400">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> at 5:57 

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Bro.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ahem.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Are you there?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I hate to be a pest about this and i know ive made a hearty trouble of myself a good deal lately...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: State your business, Jake.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I should preface this request with an overture of appreciation.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: For how much your cool and brotherly friendship means to me.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It has just been...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Absolutely *bully* having a standup gent like you in my corner.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Just a grade a dude whos a cut above the others in class and camaraderie.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Phew... *gropes for fresh kerchief.*</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I hope this shit isnt coming across as platitudinous. I really mean it!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Take it easy, bromide.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just about the only way I could salvage endearment from this perilous slope of horseshit would be to discover, really fucking soon mind you, it was a preamble to some floundering invitation for me to rush to your vicinity as nakedly as possible.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But since we've already shot that wad's eventuality on so many dry runs of flustered ambivalence that were as hilarious as they were one sided,</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That leaves only one hope for this message to avoid spiraling toward qualification as a critical fucking defect in the hull of the Mach 10 rocket that is my precious spare time.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And that hope lies in the extent to which you were practicing artful insincerity.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Now's your opportunity to pretend that's what you were gunning for. I suggest you seize it.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh. Yes! But of course.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: The ironies!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Good grief how i was bandying them just now. You know me dude.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: *Blows smoke off red hot irony pistol.*</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: *NONSUGGESTIVELY!!!!!*</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Um.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, nice.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Now that your obsequious preface has been established as indisputably entertaining for all the right reasons, and intentionally so,</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Let's bear down on these dire as shit needs you've got.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm guessing you're probably jonesing for uranium about now. No?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Pshaw! As if i would be so reckless with the stuff.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I would have to be mighty irresponsible to run out already.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No no im all set in the uranium department and really when you take a look at the big picture youll find i am *sitting pretty* when it comes to just about any radioactive isotope you could mention.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: However...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: My backup reserves that i keep strictly for emergencies are running a little lean!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You know what my grandma taught me about preparedness. *Tugs at colorful lapels.*</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You are out of uranium.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's basically mathematically impossible that's not why you're contacting me.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Christ what an insufferable awesome friend you are.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ok can you please just sendificate me some more already?? Im in kind of a hurry!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You do know my offer still stands.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You know. I've offered to construct the rabbit for you many times before. I would craft a much deadlier model.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh i know you would its just...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Damn it man ive told you this is just something i have to do myself.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its a promise i made to jade and im going to live up to it even if im not the best or even second best robosmith i know!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, I know this is your policy. You've done a good job and you should be proud.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But it's my responsibility as your friend to offer one last time.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just as it's my responsibility not to just fork over a bunch of uranium just because you ask me in a moment of weakness.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Frig!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why not???</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's too easy.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And you yourself are the one staking pride in this.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If you were half-assing this project and made some slovenly plea for it, I'd just say, fuck it, here's a lot of green rocks dude, go nuts.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ok then! Im halfassing it!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Look. See? Only a bisected bottom is present! Where is the other half you ask?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why... it is nowhere to be found. I didnt use it!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nope. Not buying it.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I know that every ounce of your premium behind can be accounted for in that rabbit, and there's no goddamned denying it.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And you know perfectly well where some more uranium can be located.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Jesus christmas you are such a fucking douche.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It seems you think I am a fucking douche.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's your opinion, I guess. That's cool.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I knew you were going to suggest this. I dont know why i bothered asking!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Strider why must you always be such an obstinate stick in the mud???</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It seems that you consider me to be, no less than one hundred percent of the time, an obstinate stick in the mud.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I unironically respect your position on this matter. Hey, let's continue to exchange ideas.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: &quot;It seems&quot;??</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh for fucks sake.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Is something the matter, Jake?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: This is your auto responder.</span>
