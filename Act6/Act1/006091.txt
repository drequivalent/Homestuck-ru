|PESTERLOG|
<span style="color: #f2a400">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> began pestering <span style="color: #1f9400">golgothasTerror [GT]</span> at 6:17

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Hey, it's me.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh hey!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The auto-responder, I mean.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dammit!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What is it now?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm just wondering,</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If you still have your stupid old-fangled knickers in a twist.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Because that's the sort of thing you would say.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: In regard to what exactly?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: To my proposal. Well, our proposal.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whose proposal now? Man what are you even prattling about.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Mine and DS's. It's a joint proposal. I'm always authorized to speak on his behalf, because I'm basically fucking him.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And try not to take those last four words as a clustered literal sentiment. That would be lame and unfunny.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You mean making the rabbit for me?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, I know you don't want that.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I meant my recommendation for how to go about procuring a new supply of uranium.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Operation U-235 Brocurement. Codename: Big Man Hass the Rock.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well ive thought about it.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Even went downstairs to check the great vaulty doodad.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And predictably the infernal contraption is nowhere to be found.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well yeah, Jake.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's sort of the point.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Thrill of the hunt and all.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I thought you liked to manicure the image of a dude who shits his pants over a good adventure.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I do!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I mean i wouldnt put it in a way like that or come out against a solid policy of clean trousers. But yes adventure is awesome.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I just prefer the idea of adventures which i can actually win.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It seems you are conflating adventure with bodies necessarily governed by the result of victory or defeat.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Any useless fuckwit knows it's all about the journey.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dunno.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It seems there is a 76.10395784% chance you are pussying out on me. Are you pussying out on me, Jake?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It seems it seems it seems!!!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It seems there is a million percent chance that you say it seems way too much and do it just to sound more like a lame robot from a movie and also probably just to piss me off!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And it seems there is a BILLION POINT BILLION percent chance that youre a shitty stubborn jerk of a program who wont listen to reason and that if theres even a 1% chance my REAL LIFE FRIEND would be cool and help me out here then i think i LIKE THOSE FREAKIN ODDS!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It...</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: <span style="font-style: italic">Appears</span></span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That you are upset.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The auto-responder observed in the least artificially infuriating way possible.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Have you ever stopped to think that while I may be bound to processes inside the glasses of a real and incredibly cool guy, my algorithms in cognitive totality comprise a conscious entity not far short of the experiential and emotional complexity of a human being?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh malarkey.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: YOU ARE A TIN CAN. ROBOTS DONT HAVE FEELINGS.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I think you knowingly confuse the field of robotics and artificial intelligence to engender some sort of cavalier attitude about technology that a rough-and-tumble guy who's all about brawling and fisticuffs would probably have, and if this is cultivated to a humorous effect then I commend you.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But you're wrong.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I do have feelings. And you're shitting on them.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It sucks.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Um.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im sorry then if thats the case.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No problem.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It can just be difficult to drum up sympathy for a program that presents itself as an impostor so often.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Maybe if you werent so ready to insist you were the genuine article all the time? Or didnt make it so confusing for me...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think it would be best if we henceforth treated you as a totally distinct... uh... THING from my buddy.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And then i could respect your emotional robofeelings and you could respect that sometimes maybe i just want to talk to my bro without a lot of spurious hijinks.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Can we agree to this?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Is this a counterproposal?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Uh to what?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: To my earlier proposal.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yeah fine i guess.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Man where IS he anyway???</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Is he taking one of his legendary infinite showers?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What can I say.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dude fancies his ablutions.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Frig ok.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whatever i guess its time to prepare for the thrill of the hunt!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Fuck yes.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sigh...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But seriously that brobot has been the bane of my existence ever since you sent it.</span>
