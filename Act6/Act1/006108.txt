<span style="color: #00d5f2">gutsyGumshoe [GG]</span> began bothering <span style="color: #1f9400">golgothasTerror [GT]</span> at 11:40 

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: J, how goes the bunnyquest?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ive barely even begun!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Tell me about it.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Youre off to a sluggish start then too i gather?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Dad has the whole house in full fatherly lockdown mode. Talk about blowing a few measly &quot;assassination attempts&quot; way out of proportion!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So I'm currently mulling over my next move.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What is it that has you hamstrung? Did you ever track down the slippery Mr. Strider?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Not exactly.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: His stupid doppelglasses have set me on a wild goose chase to go pry his dumb robots chest open and swipe its uranium.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Sounds dangerous!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No shit.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think id rather deal with the monsters.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why is it that our two best friends in the world always seem to place themselves at the source of all our problems, while simultaneously presenting their only solutions?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I know right???</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm debating whether or not to enlist his help in the matter of my current imprisonment. But I'd rather keep it as a plan of last resort.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dont do it jane its a trap!!!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: We'll see.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So I take it you're out and about now?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hell no. I spent so much time haggling with those confounded shades im only leaving my room just now.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Right. Well, not to keep you too long, since we both still have our missions ahead of us, but I wanted to tell you about that dream I had.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh yeah!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I was curious about that. Tell me everything and make it snappy!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: *Whips up bucket of freshly popped corn.*</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hoo. :B</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ok, but, I should say that the nature of the dream was a bit worrisome.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And I'm concerned it may have implications for the game we're about to play.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So it's probably best that I tell you about it before you leave.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well shoot.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ok then lay it on me jane.</span>
