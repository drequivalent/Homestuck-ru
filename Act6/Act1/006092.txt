<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I didn't send it. I sent the parts.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or, correction, DS sent them.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You then assembled it. You were therefore complicit in your own spectacular, daily humiliations.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yeah whatever.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You wanted somebody to wrestle with. DS was being a kickass bro if you ask me.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I didn't expect it to be nigh impossible to spar with!!!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You know damn well there are adjustable difficulty settings.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I have always recommending setting it to Novice, as has DS.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I know.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ive tried that.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its just...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: When hes pulling punches...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And taking it all easy and such...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And we start wrestling up a storm and whatnot...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Umm.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its just that the whole proceeding seems to become...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: A bit tender for my liking.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't understand.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Isn't that what you want from a Novice setting?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sparring with minimal discomfort?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No i know.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its all fine and dandy martially speaking.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Just the way he...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sort of...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Man its so awkward trying to convey this just never mind.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, I think I get it.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're saying you were somehow dissatisfied within the presence of my robotic avatar's personal space.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Was there an odor problem? Was the metal too hot to the touch?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Help me out.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No no.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Really never mind!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This is bullshit, Jake.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We had a pact. You were gonna tiptoe all the fuck around my brittle feelings. Totally mind the shit out of those eggshell riddled motherfuckers.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh come on dude.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What does the guy have to do, Jake?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You want to wrestle. He's fucking game. Just a man, a machine, a secluded tropical island. Sounds like you died and went to fucking heaven, if you ask me.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Seriously, what does this simple, loyal brobot have to do to prove his worth to you?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What does he have to do to make you at ease with the alkaline sting of his gentle robogrope? I really want to know.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe he should just rip his heart out of his chest and pound it into green gravel there in the jungle with his hella strong robot arm.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Invoke_Onomatopoeia(Pound * some ridiculously precise value retrieved at astonishing speed from my rad neural net);</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Check it out, little green rocks all over the goddamn place. More than you could ever hope to cram in a shoddy metal rabbit, or any other pliable orifice which might be convenient.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Because clearly its up to a soulless droid to feel emotions for the both of us, you callous, corporeal carbon ape, all trotting around with your fancy fuckin' DNA and shit.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: ...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But gosh does your prose ever make a fella feel uncomfortable.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Brose.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh right. My mistake.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You know what, I've just decided.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If the brobot's Novice setting makes you uneasy, I'm going to disable it remotely.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Done.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Now you got nothing to worry about.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Awww maaaan!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But now hell be impossible!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Happy hunting, Jake.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Fuckin.......</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: SHUCKS buster. :(</span>
