<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I woke up on the planet which we have been told about by our mutual acquaintance.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: The one covered in golden cities. Prospit, remember?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh. Wouldnt it be prospits moon?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes, you're right. It was the moon, actually. I could see the planet on the dark horizon.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I was dressed in a golden dress, like a sort of nightgown, and I could fly. I left my bedroom, which was at the top of a tall tower. Surrounding me were the gold cities, just as described.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Behind the skyline was darkness. But just above was a bright blue sky and puffy white clouds.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: That was skaia!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes, probably.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you sure you haven't woken up there before?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Haha i WISH.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I have received reports from jade about this as well. She liked to talk about her dreams on prospits moon a lot.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I see. The impression I have developed is that this is supposed to be a real place, and all who dream there have shared experiences.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Did Jade ever mention seeing us there?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No but why would she? This was long before we were born! She was dreaming there like a hundred years ago or something.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hrmm. Anyway...</span>
