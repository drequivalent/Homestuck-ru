<span style="color: #f2a400">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> began bothering <span style="color: #00d5f2">gutsyGumshoe [GG]</span> at 12:01

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why have you activated dear, sweet Huggy Bear.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Are you in danger?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh, no.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm just trying to leave my house!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Is this the real you, btw?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, it's me.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I disabled the AR for now.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ok. Just making sure!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jake was having some issues with it earlier, and I don't think he received its obfuscating tendencies in the humorous spirit intended.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes, I'm catching up with the situation now.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh, so you're talking to Jake then?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nah. Just reading their chat logs.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Man, what the fuck?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I can't leave these two alone for a minute. Can a guy get his ablutions on in fucking peace?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: :B</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Was it that bad?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not really.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The responder doesn't much distort my position on things usually.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Its demeanor leaves something desired though. I'd prefer it didn't make such aggressive and repeated claims of fidelity to my persona.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Be misrepresentin' hells of key subtleties, yo.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why not just turn it off then?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Keeps them both on their toes.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Who?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jake and the responder.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jake needs to be more skeptical. Rather than take a Pollyanna jackknife ass-first off whatever turnip truck is blowing through town that day, he's got to apply more critical reasoning to shit.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I keep telling him.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I keep telling him, dude, you got to be more like Jane.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: These lectures I presume are roughly similar in complexion to those I'm familiar with?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Those wherein I have, and I quote, &quot;got to be more like Jake?&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes, exactly.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're finally fucking getting it.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I sincerely doubt that I am!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Said the stubborn skeptic, skeptically.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Let's not talk about my &quot;issues&quot; again, shalln't we?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Shalln't?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That ain't a thing to say, even for you.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Shush!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: The word shalln't escape my vocabulary any longer, just as you SHALLN'T nitpick my language! That's my turf you're on, buster.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Alright. Kinda don't care.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What were you saying?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: About what? Jake?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: About leaving the responder on!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Anyway, I kind of owe it to him to let the program run as often as possible.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jake?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The responder.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It is a fully cognitive, self-aware entity I am responsible for, not even to mention an approximate cerebral duplicate of myself.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You don't just make a clone of yourself to live in a dead end existence where it has no chance to thrive as an individual or surpass its limitations.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That'd be sick.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: True.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Also.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The more the software runs, the broader and more detailed its experiential canopy becomes. Makes for a better dialogic partner.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Dialogic?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you saying you have conversations with your own auto-responder?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Of course.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why do you think I made the thing?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hrm, that's interesting.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I guess I always thought it was just a really elaborate gag!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's that too.</span>
