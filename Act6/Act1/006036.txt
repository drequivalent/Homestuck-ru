<span style="color: #1f9400">golgothasTerror [GT]</span> began bothering <span style="color: #00d5f2">gutsyGumshoe [GG]</span> at 11:05 

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Jane!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Forgive my botherations. I know this is meant to be a spanking ripsnorter of a day for you and all.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But do you happen to know where the devilfucking dickens mr strider might be?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh, that's fine!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I had been meaning to message you sooner actually, but I suppose in all the hubbub today, it plumb slipped my mind.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Which is a shocking fact on its lonesome, considering what I have to tell you!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Egad...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: *Loosens collar a bit.*</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: As for this Strider business, hrmmm. He's an elusive guy Jake. You know that.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I talked to him yesterday. That's as much help as I can be!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Shoot.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I really need to ask him something but hes got his blasted auto responder turned on.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hoo hoo.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I love that thing. :B</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: He wouldnt be pleased to hear you say that.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What do you need with him?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Does this have to do with your crazy pen pal project?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It most certainly does and time is of the essence!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Today is the day i have to finish it and send it. Not a day later!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So you see why i am feeling really friggin discombobulated at the moment.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Sorry, J. :(</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: This would be the birthday present... for your grandmother?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It is for your grandfather simply to be *relayed* to him by my grandmother. A joint gift to him from she and i.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Her and me.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What? Who and you now?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: &quot;A joint gift from her and me.&quot; Grammar, Jake!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh for frigs flipping sake jane this is no time for your prudish pedantry! Leave your bookish malarkey in a dusty old library somewhere. I have an adventure to get on with!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So if I have this straight, the big thing hogging up your plate today is not this marvelous new game which I have invited you to play with me, but finishing a robotic rabbit to give to my dead poppop?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Bingo. *double pistols and a wink*</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You are a very strange and silly boy.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Please jane we have addressed this.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I am sending the gift back in time to when they are both alive and about our age.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Or...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Something like that. Something funny is going on here that i have not fully grappled yet but dag nab it if im not gonna see it through.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Well,</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Godspeed, then! I do hope you can pull it off.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Are you being fresh with me now?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: No!!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Look jane i know youve never believed me and you think everything i say is some big cockamamie goofoff but i think today of all days is when you should start taking some things more seriously.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Especially since i have always had your back. I have always believed in you!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hey! I have believed in you too.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: However, believing somebody isn't the same thing as believing IN somebody.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But that much said...</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I think that maybe I am getting ready to believe some of the wild stories I've heard?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Or, if not believe outright, reserve judgment on, at least.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Is that so!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I don't know!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm still not sure what to think. But what I wanted to tell you this morning was...</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I had a really wild dream last night.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And you were in it.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh my. *glasses fog up. fumbles for kerchief.*</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Sh! Not like that.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It was so real! I think we were in the game, even though we haven't started playing yet.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I don't know what to make of it. Whether it was a vision of the future, or somewhere that exists now, or if it was just a really lucid dream due to excitement.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What was i doing there?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Um...</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Not a heck of a lot!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I really want to tell you all about it, but it will take some time to explain, and we both have things to attend to.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You with your time traveling rabbitwork, and I, my vigilant window gazing!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Too true.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Let us reconvene later and sort out all this shit at a leisurely pace.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes, ok, good luck Jake!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Okay you too jane! Bye!</span>
