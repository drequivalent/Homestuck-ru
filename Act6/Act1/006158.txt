<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Well, aside from thousands of dollars in corpse-repair richer, I can't say.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Has he been sleeping in the old man hollow again? Shit, that's adorable.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I can think of cuter places for him to sleep, frankly!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, bullshit.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He's just being instinctive. In the wild, he would gut a carcass and sleep inside for warmth, as well as to secure tactical advantage for ambushing would-be scavengers.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh, please.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Anyway, property damage and desecration to cherished elders aside, Mr. Bear has been a lovely addition to the family.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You haven't renamed him yet?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh... no.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I keep forgetting I'm supposed to!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You've got to fucking rename him. Or change him to a girl if you want. That was important.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: When pets change owners they get new names. Fact.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Sorry.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I will name him right now!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: How about Lil' Sebastian?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Fuck if that isn't the best name a thing could get.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yeah!!!</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So then, are you saying Mr. Sebastian here was an ironic present?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Relayed strictly for guffaws?? &gt;:B</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes, but it's not that simple. There were many layers involved.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Some of them are literal layers, of metal and plush.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Huh?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There's a real stuffed rabbit beneath its exoskeleton.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What! Really? :O</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It belonged to my bro.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I thought you said you didn't have such an heirloom to complete the plushie trifecta?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I didn't. He didn't give it to me, and never intended to bequeath it.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I stole it.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ooh. Risky!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nah. I got a little help from RL and ganked it out of his museum.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's this whole &quot;priceless&quot; collection of stupid shit from movies, defended like Fort Knox. Ironically of course.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So it's from a movie?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ever hear of Con Air?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Nope.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Wait...</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Wasn't that some bit of action schlock from the 90's?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Some of the silly nonsense referenced in his work was well before my time. I don't have the wherewithal to investigate all this minutia.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, it doesn't matter really. But it was from that. Dude weirdly obsessed over that shit movie for years, among others.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Know those signature shades you see him wearing on magazine covers and stuff? Another prop. A gift from Stiller himself, I believe.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That does sound a tad obsessive. Wasn't he furious about your burglary?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Pretty sure he didn't even notice. In years since, I never saw a news story about a &quot;daring heist&quot; or anything. I feel like he would have made some hay outta that.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And if he did know, he'd probably just want to give me a stoic fist bump or something.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why didn't you mention this when you gave the gift? More irony?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Essentially. It's not that easy to explain.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Broadcasting the gesture would have made it seem tawdry, and would somewhat defray its humor value.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I see. So it was like a private joke, and if anyone besides you was in on it, the joke would be ruined!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like I said, there are layers.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: On one level, I gave you a filthy tattered piece of shit, albeit of tremendous cultural significance, manhandled by some old B movie actors, now candy coated to function as a highly practical defender droid for your personal protection.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: On another level, I needed to incorporate something passable as a real heirloom.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: For sentimental reasons.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: D'awwwww.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Wait, real sentiment, or ironic sentiment?</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Or is there no difference?? Am I missing the point here?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, it was genuine.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The upper echelons of irony should always include measures of sincerity. And if the satirical practice is executed faithfully it will achieve something bona fide in its own right regardless.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Through an intense commitment bordering on religious devotion to the absolutely inane, absurd, or plain fucking stupid, a very different kind of sincerity begins to materialize. One of reverence to the ridiculous. You begin to &quot;mean it,&quot; but what exactly it is you mean is never quite what appears on the surface, and is utterly inaccessible to obtuse and literal minds. That you &quot;mean it&quot; then becomes inseparable from the joke, and additional rich strata of humor may be stripped aggressively from this irreconcilable truth.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: This is fascinating, if a wee bit more dissertation than I bargained for this morning.</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I have so much to learn. And I am not even saying that &quot;ironically!&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Will you teach me your ways one day, sir? Perhaps an apprenticeship will open?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh god, I'd love that.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Consider the position yours for the taking any time. Feel free to approach and kneel before Cal. With my sword and his floppy mitten, you will receive my flashstep anointment shoulder to shoulder, and to shoulder again.</span>
