<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Look at that statement you just made.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's time for me to respond with some words, ideally chosen and arranged in a way that will wreck your shit, in a subtle and psychologically devastating way.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Har har har!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Just soooo &quot;*irooooonic*!!!&quot; Quotes quotes quotes.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im laughing my caboose STRAIGHT OFF THE TRACKS! A lot of families just died in the tragic derailment.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, the caboose remark was actually pretty funny, Jake.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If I truly were what you say I am, I wouldn't be able to feel the human emotions of joy and laughter. No?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Laughter isnt an emotion dickprince!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I think you should back your claims up with proof before you go heaving around such accusations.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Man its so flipping obvious.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You start getting kind of extra technical and vague and automoton like.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And kind of aloof and brusque.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I mean...</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Even aloofier and brusquier than usual!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Also you use the phrase &quot;it seems&quot; a lot. Its so silly it really blows the AI immersion man.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Bullshit.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm being like, the perfect dude right now. A fully fucking legitimate human being.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ok then check this out mr legit human dude.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Excuse me sir not to be a bother but could you please tell me all about this strider fellows auto responder?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It seems you have asked about DS's chat client auto-responder. This is an application designed to simulate DS's otherwise inimitably rad typing style, tone, cadence, personality, and substance of retort while he is away from the computer. The algorithms are guaranteed to be 96% indistinguishable from DS's native neurological responses, based on some statistical analysis I basically just pulled out of my ass right now.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You see!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What if I was just fucking with you there?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Would it really be so unthinkable for a human to type that?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Because you always say shit like that after i catch wise to your games.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You as in the auto responder!!!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Unimpressed.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Logical fallacies are as pervasive throughout your argument as your antiquated verbal tics.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh yeah?</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hey. Tell me about the auto responder. Make it snappy shitknickers!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It seems you have asked about DS's chat client auto-responder. This is an application designed to simulate DS's otherwise inimitably rad typing style, tone, cadence, personality, and substance of retort while he is away from the computer. The algorithms are guaranteed to be 93% indistinguishable from DS's native neurological responses, based on some statistical analysis I basically just pulled out of my ass right now.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Gee dude you sure typed that exact same thing pretty fast.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Are you still fucking with me??</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It could be a coincidence that I typed the same answer.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You always type that answer!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It could be a coincidence that I always type the same answer.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Uuuuuuugh.</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I cant stand this. Every time we do this and i just wind up whistling sweet dixie out of my bum hole!</span>
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: This is pointless im not having this conversation unless its with my REAL LIFE FRIEND. THE ONE WITH HUMAN FEELINGS WHO ISNT A PRETEND PERSON INSIDE SUNGLASSES.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, but I'm pretty sure he's going to share my position on the matter.</span>
