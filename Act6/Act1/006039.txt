Yep. This one changed too. Crockercorp is nothing if not thorough with its branding tactics. You <span style="font-style: italic">guess</span> it's pretty cool? It's just a fork instead of a spoon. Not the most awe inspiring logo you've ever seen, but who are you to judge? Aside from the future owner of the company.

(You make a mental note that when you turn 18 and inherit the company you will change it back to a spoon, you love the spoon.)
