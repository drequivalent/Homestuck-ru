At the center, you find a little stage that looks perfect for supporting a spectacularly silly dance. Or it would if standing on it didn't make you a little nervous, and also if that didn't sound like a retarded idea given the circumstances. 

It looks sort of like the various contraptions you've been deploying in John's house. You wonder what it does?
