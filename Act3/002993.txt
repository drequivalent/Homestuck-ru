<span style="color: #008141">GA: Why Is It That When The Subject Of Temporal Mechanics Is Broached Your Sparing Human Intellects Instantly Assume The Most Ingratiating Posture Of Surrender Imaginable</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Time Is Not That Difficult To Understand</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Is A Utility That A Universe May Resort To In Order To Advance A Desired Degree Of Complexity</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Or May Not Resort To If That Is The Case</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Its All Pretty Pedestrian</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But No </span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: When Time Travel Comes Up You Present The Face That A Man Shows When The Breeze Gradually Alerts Him To His Absence Of Netherdressings</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Dont See How We Are To Properly Agitate You All If You Continue To Insist On Failing To Understand Basic Concepts Which Common Infants Effortlessly Manage To Describe Via Scrawlings In Their Own Puddles Of Sloppy Discharge</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Have we spoken before?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes </span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: In The Future</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You and your friends never cease to invent ways to strengthen the credibility of your assertions.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Oh My It Is Your Human Sarcasm Again</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Enjoy Listening To It And I Wish Doing So Could Serve As My Primary Form Of Recreation</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: There See I Just Did It Too</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Saying The Opposite Thing To Emphasize My Contempt</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But Suddenly I Feel More Primitive And Hate Myself A Little More</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Was Like This Funny Miracle That Just Happened In My Heart</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I would admire the sophistication of you and your fellow future-dwellers a little more if you seemed to be aware the word &quot;human&quot; only functions as that sort of adjective in bad science fiction.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But I won't be rude and change the subject.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: There's a still a bit of unflagellated straw poking out of your rhetorical effigy over here.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Oh Dear</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: No We Arent From &quot;The Future&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But We Are All Already In Agreement That You Dont Get It And Never Will</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I thought you said we spoke in the future.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: We Did</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Your Future</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: For Me It Was Only A Couple Minutes Ago</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I understand.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You exist in some temporal stratum through which you have communication access to various points of my timeline.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's not that complicated.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes Thats Right</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Will You Try To Talk Some Sense Into Your Idiot Friends</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: So That We May Proceed To Bother Them All On More Rational Terms</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I try to every day, with mixed results.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But you see, it's not that I don't understand you.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's just that I don't believe you.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Because it's nonsense.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Albeit persistent and coordinated nonsense.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why would a bunch of temporally dislocated trolls want to harass a group of friends throughout completely random points in time?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Will Admit This Campaign Of Provocation Wasnt All That Well Thought Out</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Dont Tell Anyone I Said That</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Alright.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe you should get some trolling tips from us humans.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Our sparing intellects are probably better suited to it.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yeah Maybe</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Why Dont We Be Friends</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You want to be my friend?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Think So</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Think Were Supposed To</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: You Suggested As Much Earlier</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You mean I did in the future?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes A Couple Minutes Ago</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Probably because I remembered you mentioning it in the conversation we're having now?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Thats Likely</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hmm.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Your commitment to this roleplaying scenario is intriguing.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What choice do I have but to accept?</span>
