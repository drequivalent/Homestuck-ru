You are no doubt reading this as a handsome and strapping young man! Why, the mangrit needed to lift the book is itself a sign of your maturity, not even to speak of the wisdom needed to grasp the nuance of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sassacre</span>'s time-tested mischief. I am so proud of you, grandson!

How I wish I could have delivered this heirloom to you in the flesh. But I am afraid it wasn't in the cards! For you see, John, like you, this book must yet take a journey! Its journey will end on the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Final Day</span> of my life, and even then will continue some. Though I suppose that will be up to your <span style="text-decoration: underline">Father</span>. Perhaps he will discuss it with you one day, when he and you are ready.

But it is your journey I am writing about to wish you luck! There will come a day when you will be thrust into another world. And once you arrive, that is only the beginning! You will soon delve even deeper into a realm of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Warring Royalty</span> in a <span style="text-decoration: underline">Timeless Expanse</span>. A realm of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Agents</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Exiles</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Consorts</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Kernelsprites</span>. Of toiling <span style="text-decoration: underline">Underlings</span> and slumbering <span style="text-decoration: underline">Denizens</span>. A realm where four will gather, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Heir of Breath</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Seer of Light</span>, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Knight of Time</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Witch of Space</span>, and together they will <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ascend</span>.

John, if only you knew how important you were! I regret my passing came so early in your life. And yet I feel in my heart we have already met. But what I know for sure is that we will meet again! 

Until then, John, I do hope your <span style="text-decoration: underline">Father</span> keeps you well fed!
