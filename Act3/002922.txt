<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, while i make some stuff here can you keep an eye out for imps?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: just keep the safe or tub handy or something.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it'll serve them right for trashing my posters.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I keep telling you the posters were always like that.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: AND I KEEP TELLING YOU HA HA VERY FUNNY</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Here, look.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/O413nanna" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://tinyurl.com/O413nanna</a></span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, i saw those, but...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: they didn't look like that before. you must have changed them.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Even if I had the motive for such a bizarre and pointless deception, where would I find the time?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't even have Photoshop.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: then why didn't you TELL me they were there???</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I had no reason to think you were not aware of them.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I thought they were strange, certainly, but was not struck by any particular impulse to discuss them.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, it still doesn't make sense though.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: implying that i drew them a while ago and then forgot and couldn't see them and now suddenly see them.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that's stupid, what would that even mean.</span>
