<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wow, what are you doing by the way?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: rose, sorry to say but this is all looking kind of silly!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm trying to spread the upward construction around so there is a more substantial foundation for later on.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But I'm starting to wonder if it will be strong enough.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's kind of starting to wobble a little.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't think brick chimneys were meant to serve this architectural purpose.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah no shit!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I might have to adopt a different building strategy.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Stick to more load-bearing walls, and blockier shapes, especially since grist has been easier to come by lately.</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Right.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: STRIIIIIIDEEEERRRRRRRR!!!!!</span>
