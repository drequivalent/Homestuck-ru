Your expanded CACHE LIMIT is more than enough to accommodate the grist windfall.

You gather up 2260 pieces of BUILD GRIST, 1040 pieces of SHALE, 490 drops of TAR, and 350 drops of MERCURY.

You can't wait to find out what amazing items this new supply of grist will be just barely insufficient to produce.
