<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I require a font of frighteningly accurate yet infuriatingly nonspecific information.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Do you know where I can find a wellspring of this sort?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: hahaha yes ok but we cant talk for long!!!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You have plans? </span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well yes i do but its just that you will lose your internet connection soon!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: and we wont talk again for a pretty long time</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: not until you enter!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Enter?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This is what I was talking about.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This was the itch that needed scratching. </span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: My avarice for the inscrutable. It is limitless.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: lol what did you want to know?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You've been insisting today was the big day.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We would all play a game you didn't know the name of.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: A game you said I'd get in the mail, and did.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: One that would help me answer some questions.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But Strider is being obtuse, I can't catch John at his computer, you don't even have the game yourself, and on top of all that, my internet is unstable.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So are you sure today is the day?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: there sure are a lot of challenges but yes i am sure!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: dave is cool, you know he will come around when the time is right</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: he just has a lot of work to do first</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: and so do you! </span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: youll need to keep searching for a stable signal and power source, it will be hard but dont give up!!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: and dont worry about me either, focus on playing with john first</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it all starts with you two!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is there nothing else you can say to prepare me for this?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm sure you think little of blithely upsetting dark forces with Grandpa Moreau over there on Hellmurder Island, but honestly I've only read a few books on it.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: haha dark? thats ridiculous!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i dont really know what to tell you other than its not going to be what you think it is</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: and most importantly you will have your questions answered, but they will be the ones you havent thought to ask yet!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: just be patient and be brave youll see</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it will be fun!!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: uh oh looks like youve got to go</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: take care rose! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3</span>
