<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't like to use the word &quot;crazy&quot;.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh god.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: see?? this is therapy bullshit!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That was a joke.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But anyway, whether it means you are crazy or not, consider this theory:</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Your presumably longstanding tendency for scrawling this imagery is really your subconsious trying to express something disturbing within you.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Possibly something from your past, which you have blocked out.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And since you have supressed it, your conscious self cannot acknowledge the drawings, therefore they have been invisible until now.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why now?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Perhaps because you have seen evidence that conflicts with the worldview your subconscious has constructed to obfuscate the truth.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That your dad is not necessarily the clown-loving maniac you thought he was.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: All along, this negative attribute buried in your psyche may have been projected on to him, and subsequently reviled, as a sort of defense mechanism.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but this is absurd, my dad LOVES these shitty clowns.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: he's got all these statues and paintings EVERYWHERE.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is it unthinkable that over the years it was he who believed you were the one with a passion for clowns? Because of the all the strange drawings in your room?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: A father then embraces a son's hobby to establish a stronger bond.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Or wages a campaign of passive-aggresive mockery of your interests.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Either is plausible. I don't know your dad that well.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i dunno.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: not sure about all this.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but i think we need to stop and acknowledge the bunny sassacre fedora i just made.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's awesome.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah.</span>
