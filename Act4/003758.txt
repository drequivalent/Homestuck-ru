<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Do I have to explain everything to you twice now?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: no i know</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: im using daves spare computer i saw the whole conversation through his pesterchum account</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh, I see.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So instead of having to double explain, I merely have to put up with being double spied upon.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What a relief!</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: i just mean</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: you didnt burn that book in the future</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: that book was completely pointless</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I know.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But now it's not.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You appeared to make it relevant by traveling to the past.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: so does that mean the sleeping thing worked</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: you remember the future</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I remember some things.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: ok cool</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: so why is the cat code so terrible now</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But the gods were pretty emphatic about it.</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: well ok i guess its done but why are you so sure theyre right</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Have you ever known them to be wrong?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: i guess not</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: but they sort of freak me out</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: i mean listening to gross space mutants all day isnt my idea of an awesome time</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: especially the ones that sing oh god</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is that why you always kept the music turned up?</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: no i flip out to ill jams because they kick ass</span>
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: obviously</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess we'll chalk another riddle up in the solved column.</span>
