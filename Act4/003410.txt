<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i guess we keep getting more with each server/client connection!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so i guess you can buy everything now</span>

<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: they cost a fortune</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: well all i got here is the designix which i cant deploy cause i dont have any purples</span>

<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: when john connects with me he will probably get some cool new things too!</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: hey look we're learning stuff</span>
