<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I spoke with Jaspers.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I didn't understand what he told me.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: He said I'll understand once I &quot;wake up&quot;.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: For some reason this made me think of you.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: hehehe......</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah i bet hes right!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We wouldn't happen to be talking about awakening in a sort of breezy, philosophical sense, would we?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is my dead cat concerned with my enlightenment? Should I prepare to shed this coil of ignorance and suffering?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: wow no i dont think so...</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: hes being a bit more literal than that!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: what did he say?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I doubt I could reproduce the statements with fidelity.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It was like listening to a five year-old describe a dream.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The content manages to take a back seat to the simple heartwarming spectacle of the moment.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: :)</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well what he meant was.....</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: that you have a dream self</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: who is supposed to wake up whenever your real self goes to sleep</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: we all do! all four of us i mean</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but see your dream self still stays asleep when you go to sleep</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: because you havent woken up yet!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think I get it.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I take it your &quot;dream self&quot; is wide awake when you sleep?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And would I be out of line in additionally presuming this has been the case for many years, at least as long as I've known you?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: no you would not be out of line!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: in fact im asleep now</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That was to be my next wild presumption.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: :p</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So when I wake up, can I look forward to being able to message people in my sleep too?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: no only i can do that!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: because of my robot</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh, right.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I forgot about your robot.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: My short term recall seems to eschew the profoundly ridiculous.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you guys can probably make your own i guess......</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but you need to wake up first for it to matter and maybe by the time that happens you might not even need them!!!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm not sure if necessity is a concept I'd associate with such a contraption even under some of the more obscure scenarios imaginable.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But good to know I guess.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Here's another question, which I'm sure will look stupid once I've finished typing it.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: If my dream self is asleep, does that mean she's dreaming, and if she is, who's dreaming the dream, her or me?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: um.......</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ok well i dont really know how to answer the second part but yeah shes dreaming!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: shes most likely lying in your bed troubled and restless</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: about things burdening her</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: which is to say you!!!!!</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: things about who you really are and what your purpose is</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but you cant start figuring those things out yet because youre not awake because youre not ready yet</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: thats why you have such terrible dreams all the time rose!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok. How do I wake up?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: im sure it would help to start piecing together the clues to nudge your subconscious</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: or maybe face some things you havent faced yet?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i dunno! its for you to find out</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: maybe the stuff you wrote on your walls can give you a clue?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What stuff?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: the....</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: er</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: didnt dave tell you?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Tell me what?</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ._.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you saying he said I defaced the walls of my room?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: While not appearing to be cognizant of the scrawlings?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Like John?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I really hope that's not what you're saying.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It might freak me out.</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: he said he was going to tell you &lt;_&lt;;</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hold on.</span>
