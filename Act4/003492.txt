-- grimAuxiliatrix <span style="color: #008141">[GA]</span> began trolling tentacleTherapist <span style="color: #b536da">[TT]</span> --

<span style="color: #008141">GA: Your Dark Spectacled Friend Has Advised Me On A More Effective Method For Trolling You</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Think His Contention Is That This Strategy Will Have The Opposite Of The Intended Effect And Precipitate A Sort Of Bond Between Us That Is Established In Mutual Antagonism</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: What Do You Think About This</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think you're shrewd to have recognized his ploy of sabotage, and you've earned my compliments.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Ah See It Is Working Already</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What is?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Ive Listened To His Advice</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Have Resolved To Modify The Approach Slightly</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Know What I Have To Do</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: What We Have To Do Really</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What's that?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Remember The First Time We Spoke</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes, but you said it wasn't the first time you spoke to me.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We'll graciously omit my embarrassing skepticism however.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The First Time You Spoke To Me Was The Second Time I Spoke To You</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This conversation doesn't sound like your first time either.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: This Is Your Second Conversation With Me But Is My Seventh With You</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And when exactly does your maiden encounter take place?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Thats Next Time</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So to clarify.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: If the matching of my first with your second is denoted by 1=2, then the sequence would be:</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: 1=2, 2=7, 3=1, 4=?, ...</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes And The Rest Of The Sequence Is Simply</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: 4=3, 5=4, 6=5, 7=6</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Unless My Future Self Stowed Another Conversation In Between One Of Those Which Is Entirely Possible</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But Urrgh I Dont Want To Think About That</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why is it that when the subject of temporal mechanics is broached your sparing troll intellects etcetera etcetera.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: See That Is What I Mean Rose You Are Not As Dumb Of A Girl As I Was Initially Lead To Believe</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You mean based on the first impression I am apparently about to make in our next conversation?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What could I possibly say that will leave such an imprint?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: That Is Why I Have Contacted You Now</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Will Send You A Copy Our First Conversation Directly From My Chat Log</span>

-- grimAuxiliatrix <span style="color: #008141">[GA]</span> sent tentacleTherapist <span style="color: #b536da">[TT]</span> the file &quot;ConversationWithAVeryStupidGirl.Txt&quot; --

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess being forced to cooperate with a stable time loop is the only plausible explanation for my remarks.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes And Then I Found It Sort Of Curious That During My Next Conversation With You Your Various Mental Endowments And Wherewithals Were Not As They Seemed</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Suspected The Stratagem Might Be A Counter Trolling Measure But Then Was Not So Sure And Further Examination Grew Warrant</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And what if my counter-counter measure is to choose not to transcribe this dialogue accurately in the future-first place?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But See I Have Edited The Copy Already In Ways That Will Remain Secret For Now But You Will Discover Once You Type It</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: So You Are Destined To Edit It No Matter What And What You Submit Will Be What I Once Read Regardless</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: !</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Unless I decide to copy it word-for-word!</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes Unless I Lied About Editing It In The First Place</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Either Way Through Knowledge Of What You Will Say I Have Precisely Engineered The Nature Of Your Transgression</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: !!!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So your trolling strategy now is to put idiotic words in my mouth through the machinery of temporal inevitability, and cause me to excruciate over how to subvert the transcription?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: While being perfectly up front about it?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes I Suppose Its That Sarcasm All The Time Seems Laborious To Me</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'll admit, it's a more advanced tactic than I gave you credit for.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes And The Providence Of This Antagonism Ninja Vice Grip Pinching Your Larynx Has Already Begun To Supply My Purpose With Fruit</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Chilly Frost Shimmering On Our Tree Of Human Friendship Has Begun To Thaw</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Mixed metaphor aside, usually ninjas don't announce what they're doing when they're doing it.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Like when stalking an emperor to assassinate him.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Or befriend him.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But that's fine.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess the only pointless question we haven't exhausted is, why?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why the convoluted artifice?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Dave Raised Insight Into The Human Psychology Of Friendship Development</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: By Allotting You Your Side Of The Conversation I Have You At The Disadvantage In Your View And You Will Seek To Reclaim Higher Ground</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: In Successive Conversations</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: 4=3 And 5=4 And Such</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Your Demeanor Will Be Terse If Not Saturated With Disdain And It Will Cause Me To Be Confused And Question Your Motivation</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But Now I Know Your Motivation Because I Am Supplying It Here And Now</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: They Will Be Simple Acts Of Friendly Human Retaliation</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So you're not only rigging the first impression I make on you, but orchestrating my revenge for the rigging as well?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Seems Friendship For Some Humans Is A Basic Aggregation Of Shallow And Insincere Hostilities</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's an interesting take on it.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But now I know for sure Dave isn't behind this plan.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's too complicated.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Dont Understand</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Who Better To Coordinate Such Events Than The Knight Of Time</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You're awfully quick to his defense.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you sure you don't have a thing for him?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's ok, bro. You can admit it.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I'm Hopping To 8=8</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Ideally You Will Have Long Since Discarded This Train Of Thought</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm going to talk to my dead cat.</span>
