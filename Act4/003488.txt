<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im building up your house</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: by the way why do you live in this weird compound</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: do you host east european industrial raves</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: nevermind the point is</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im out of grist</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so if youre done whipping that ogre like a rented mule</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: maybe you could convert it into a grist windfall</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Right now?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The spoils would sink.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i dont know beach the thing first i guess</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: unless you were planning on sailing that ogre down the mississippi with a runaway slave</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And then what?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what do you mean</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you kill it</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: release a shitload of grist</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: maybe take one of your needles and puncture the base of its skull</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: does it even have a skull</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or a brain stem</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: can you find out</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That sounds malicious.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but you just rigged the thing with an oedipal harness and rode its torso like a log flume ride down a magical rainbow</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That was self defense.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Murdering a wounded behemoth in its sleep strikes me as unseemly.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: this is bullshit its an unfeeling monster who gives a fuck</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe you could replicate a pillow I could use to smother it.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Make it a clean hit.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I would use one of mine but they've all mysteriously gone missing.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: wow fuck ok</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you can either kill it for the loot or wait a couple hours for gristtorrent to steal more of johns</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but then again ill be pretty busy in a couple hours so make up your mind</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Does John know we've been sapping his grist yet?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no but hes still got a ton so screw him</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hold on, someone's messaging me.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah me too</span>
