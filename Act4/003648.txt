You hurry to the door so you can catch John before he goes gallivanting off somewhere.

But it seems your door is ajar. Funny, you don't remember leaving your door ajar. Even though it's sort of absurd for you to take note of such a thing, considering John recently left your room. 

Oh well, it doesn't matter. You will now proceed through this door uneventfully.
