<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Jade is connected with you?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Where did she get the discs?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i dont know how does she do any of the loopy batshit nonsense she does</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: maybe she pulled them out of the volcano over there on bloodmonkey mountain</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Wait.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So you mean to tell me she was able to connect with you in a timely fashion, without waiting until you were on the brink of annihilation?</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: we went over this</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i was a little bogged down</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: in the epic swaddle of legendary puppet taint</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've done nothing but wait for boys to play this game with me all day.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: First John lollygagging with the client, and then you with the server, downright filibustering my existence with unending fraternal melee.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And yet a girl, one who didn't even own the game, was able to connect with you minutes after you connected with me.</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: whoa wait</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what the hell is she doing</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: shes taking my bed what the hell</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And there she goes.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: She HAS the karma.</span>
