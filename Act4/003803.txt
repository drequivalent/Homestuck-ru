<span style="color: #626262">CG: SEE THIS IS A CASE IN POINT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what point?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THE POINT I WAS JUST MAKING.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: ABOUT THE ULTIMATE RIDDLE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU BLITHERING FECULENT SHITHOLE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OK THAT'S YOUR CUE TO LAUGH AT ME SOME MORE I GUESS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO REALLY GET OFF WHENEVER I FLAME YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HUMANS ARE DERANGED.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh man, i must be getting closer to the conversations where you're trolling me harder!</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: this is pretty exciting, i can't wait to see what you've got up your sleeve.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN??? FUCK YOU ABOUT THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: anyway, you weren't making a point about the ultimate riddle, dude.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YES I WAS, AND NOW I'M LOSING MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT DIPSHIT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: nope, we never talked about it.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yet...</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OH HELL, THAT'S RIGHT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: DAMMIT, I GUESS THIS IS GOING TO BE CONFUSING.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, you're just starting to figure that out now?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SEE I KIND OF PAINTED MYSELF INTO A CORNER.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I STARTED TROLLING YOU AT THE END, JUST BEFORE THE RIFT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND THEN JUMPED BACK A LITTLE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND NOW I GUESS I'VE BECOME RAILROADED INTO WORKING BACKWARDS HERE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: UNLESS I WANT TO DO THE SORT OF DUMB SCHIZOPHRENIC HOPPING AROUND LIKE THE OTHERS.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh my god, i know, you've already told me like a million times!!!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I HAVE?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WOW I CAN'T WAIT FOR ALL THESE AMAZING CONVERSATIONS TO TAKE PLACE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THAT HUMAN VACATION WITH THE GIANT RED CHIMNEY ASSHOLE UP IN HERE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU KNOW, THE ONE WHERE A BUNCH OF MOANY NOOKSUCKERS SING AT A LITTLE PINE TREE I THINK.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: man, i've got to say i'm a little disappointed by this &quot;masterful trolling&quot; you were bragging about.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I WAS BRAGGING?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHY WOULD I BOTHER WITH THAT SORT OF PEDANTIC HUMAN HORSESHIT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THAT I WAS BRAGGING TO GET YOUR HOPES UP IN THE FUTURE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: ONLY TO LET YOU DOWN.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND THUS TROLL YOU MASTERFULLY IN THAT RESPECT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: maybe, but that would be pretty weak too!!!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOUR BRITTLE HUMAN CALCIUM BASED SKULL IS WHAT IS WEAK, AND IF YOU AND I WERE IN THE PROXIMITY OF A BLUNT INSTRUMENT I WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH TROUBLE PROVING IT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: w/e.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so what was the &quot;case in point&quot; you were making, anyway?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I WAS SCROLLING BACK AND NOTICED YOU WERE IN THE VEIL.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: whoa, i am?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH DUMBDUMB, YOU'RE TUMBLING AROUND ON A BIG GODDAMN METEOR.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND YOU JUST CREATED YOUNGER VERSIONS OF YOURSELVES AND YOUR GUARDIANS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: PROBABLY BY MUCKING AROUND WITH THAT THING LIKE A DOOFUS.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wait...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: these are baby versions of us?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HAHAHAHAHAHA, SO CLUELESS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING THERE ANYWAY.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i saw footage of my nanna, and some other people who i am pretty sure were like jade's grandpa and rose's mom and stuff from a long time ago.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and then...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: there were all these little guys scurrying around.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so they are like cloned copies of us?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: NO.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THEY ARE LITERALLY YOU AND YOUR GUARDIANS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: PARADOX CLONES.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: huh?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what do you mean they are literally us?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: do they go back in time?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH, OBVIOUSLY. GREAT GUESS BRAIN HERO.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT TECHNICALLY THEY AREN'T EVEN SENT BACK IN TIME BECAUSE WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDIUM YOUR UNIVERSE'S TIMELINE IS MEANINGLESS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SERIOUSLY WHY WOULD IT GIVE A CRAP ABOUT EARTH'S PAST OR FUTURE OR WHATEVER, FROM IT'S PERSPECTIVE IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF POINTS TO CHOOSE FROM.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: JUST LIKE YOUR CHRONOLOGY IS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT I GUESS THAT'S A BUNCH OF SEMANTICS. WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL CHRONOLOGY YEAH THEY GO BACK IN TIME.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: A PARADOX CLONE IS BY DEFINITION A CORRECTLY CLONED DUPLICATE THAT WILL INEVITABLY GO BACK IN TIME AND BECOME THE ORIGINAL TARGET THAT WAS CLONED.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IF IT'S A MALFORMED CLONE, IT'S JUST A MEANINGLESS MUTANT THAT HAS NO BEARING ON THE STABLE LOOP CONTINUUM.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I DON'T SEE ANY TENTACLES OR EXTRA EYEBALLS OR WARPED BONE BULGES, SO THOSE GROSS LITTLE THINGS THERE ARE ALL YOU GUYS, WAITING TO GO TO EARTH AND GROW UP AND BECOME THE INSIPID BUNCH OF GRUBFISTED DOUCHEBAGS YOU ALL ARE NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND THIS WAS THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE ABOUT THE ULTIMATE RIDDLE.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what is the riddle anyway?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: maybe i can guess, i am good at riddles!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HAHAHA, THINK AGAIN IGNORAMUS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT'S NOT EVEN THAT GREAT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OR EVEN MUCH OF A RIDDLE AT ALL.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IN THE COURSE OF YOUR ADVENTURE YOU WOULD HAVE ENCOUNTERED ALL THESE FRAGMENTS OF LIKE WEIRD POEMS AND SHIT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU FIND THEM ALONG YOUR QUESTS, WITH CLUES AND STUFF BURIED IN THEM TO HELP YOU SOLVE PUZZLES AND MOVE HUGE STONE COLUMNS AND MAKE STAIRCASES APPEAR AND LOTS OF NONSENSE LIKE THAT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND IT'S ALL MASKED IN THIS FLOWERY SORT OF FROTHY POETIC JACKASSERY THAT NOBODY REALLY CARES ABOUT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND I SURE AS HELL DON'T CARE ABOUT SPOILING IT FOR YOU.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT WHAT ALL THESE LOFTY SYMBOLIC ALLUSIONS BOIL DOWN TO IS SOME GRANDER STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE HAPPENING HERE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THAT YOU WERE ALWAYS THE KEY TO SEEDING YOUR OWN EXISTENCE THROUGH THIS GAME.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND ANY HOPE THAT IT COULD HAVE PLAYED OUT DIFFERENTLY OR THAT YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED THIS WHOLE MESS WAS ALWAYS JUST A RUSE.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: a distaction, perhaps?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: nevermind.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T GO DOWN THIS WAY THEN HOW WERE YOU EVEN BORN, GET IT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHICH IS ESPECIALLY PATHETIC SINCE PARADOX SPACE APPARENTLY WENT TO ALL THIS TROUBLE TO MAKE YOU JUST TO HAVE YOU FAIL AND DIE.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: REALLY THERE'S NOTHING MORE TRAGIC THAN THESE NULL SESSIONS FULL OF KIDS ENTERING THE GAME AND FULFILLING SOME COSMIC DESTINY SHIT JUST TO GET WIPED OUT AND LEAVE BEHIND AN EMPTY POINTLESS INCIPISPHERE FOR ALL ETERNITY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: ACTUALLY IT'S SORT OF HILARIOUS.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OR IT WOULD BE IF IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME PERSONALLY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT ANYWAY, THERE'S A LOT MORE TO THE RIDDLE THAN JUST THAT, LIKE WHAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT LAST TIME WE TALKED.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT THAT'S SORT OF THE GIST OF THE THEMES IT DEALS WITH.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, if i run into some salamanders who tell me all about this riddle and get really excited about it, i will try to act surprised.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so this is the same kind of thing you went through?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: with, like, being your own paradox clones and creating your own parents and stuff?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: how did that even work, with 12 of you?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT WAS REALLY FUCKING COMPLICATED AND I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO IT.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OUR FAMILY STRUCTURES ARE ALREADY WAY MORE COMPLICATED THAN YOURS WITHOUT EVEN GETTING SPOOKY TIME SLIME INVOLVED.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BASICALLY WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WHATSOEVER.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: EXCEPT MAYBE THIS...</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I WAS THE GUY IN YOUR POSITION, TO MAKE ALL THESE CLONES, AND FRANKLY IT ALL KIND OF FREAKED ME THE HELL OUT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: huh...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, i guess now that you mention it, i am finding it all a little strange...</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OH, ONLY JUST NOW???</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: FUCK YOU ARE FAST, I HOPE YOU GOT THE MAD BOONBUCKS TO PAY OFF THOSE SPEEDING TICKETS.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no, no, i mean the ghost stuff and paradoxes are one thing of course...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it's something else.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it's just...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: this is really weird...</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT IT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, normally humans hatch...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: from like these slimy pods.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: then we wriggle out as a little pink larva.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OH REALLY.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HUH, MAYBE WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN I THOUGHT.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: (hehehehehehehe)</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: MAYBE THOSE REALLY ARE MUTANT CLONES AND THEY AREN'T GOING BACK TO SEED YOUR PLANET???</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: um...</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: sure...?</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HELL, I'M CONFUSED NOW.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: NOT THAT I GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU AND YOUR POINTLESS AWFUL LIVES.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hey, i have an idea.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why don't you get back to me in a few minutes?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i mean like a few minutes of my time, not yours.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: all of these little pink monkeys are getting way out of line and i have to tend to them.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: if you message me in a couple minutes, we can continue conversing in a sane, linear fashion for a change!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: UM, OK?</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and then after that you can keep going backwards and then make fun of me riding my little red rocket.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: you can tell me i look like a silly little paradox clone fresh out of my slime tube and this is just all a big nurseytime recess jamboree.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that would burn me good!</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OK THAT IS PRETTY GOOD.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT I CAN'T USE IT, BECAUSE YOU SAID IT, AND THEN LATER, I.E. RIGHT NOW, YOU WOULD GET THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING YOU WERE THE ONE TO COME UP WITH THAT BURN.</span>
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SEE, YOU ARE DEALING WITH A PRO, YOU CAN'T OUT TROLL ME SO JUST FORGET ABOUT IT AND STOP TRYING.</span>
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: (hehehehehehehehehehehe)</span>
