<span style="color: #008141">GA: Im Supposed To Antagonize A Few Members Of Your Trivial Species</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Have To Start Somewhere</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Somewhen</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: So I Am Starting With You</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Now</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Its Going To Be Pointless And Unpleasant</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Mostly For Me</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Actually You Know What</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Im Not Really Feeling This At All</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Goodbye</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: she's not here right now, she's asleep!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: but ok, see you.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Is This</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Your Human Sarcasm That Ive Heard About</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: That You Always Use</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And That Is Basically A Terrible Way To Communicate</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: umm... no?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Thought That Was The Thing You Did</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Rose Human Specifically</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: oh, yeah.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: that's me! i am the rose human. look at me, i am so smart with all these snooty words and complicated things to say.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: i am the queen of books.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Okay These Are Definitely Insincere Statements</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Why Do You Work So Hard At Being So Awful</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: fffuuhhhhhhhh</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: i'm so burned, these burns are crazy.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: can we just cut to the chase and be friends already??</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: these cat and mouse games are so dumb, you know we're just going to all be friends at some point anyway.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Have We Spoken Before</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: i don't know, uh, maybe???</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: it's hard to keep track with all your time nonsense.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Now That I Think About It It Is Pretty Conceivable That I Will Talk To You Again In The Past After This Conversation</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: that's because you guys always do things the hard way.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: and the dumb way.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Should Figure Out How The Viewport Feature Of This Application Works</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: So I Can See What Such A Primitive Creature Looks Like</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: haha, well i know what you guys look like.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: you look kind of like...</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: howie mandel from little monsters.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: even though, to be perfectly frank, he was kind of a big monster.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: because he was a big goofy adult.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: and fred savage was like his child prankster sidekick.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: no, it's a movie.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: you should ask john about it, because he thinks it's awesome, which it is.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Seems You Put Stock In Johns Assessment Of Things</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Even Really Uninteresting Things That Are Pretty Terrible To Listen To</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: He Is Either The Leader Of Your Party Or You Hold Whatever The Human Equivalent Of Mating Fondness For Him Is</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: yeah, i got him this really cool bunny for his birthday, and it's really nicely knitted and everything.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: because i am basically in love with him, you are right.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Uh Okay</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: heh, just kidding. i'm sure john knows it's cause i am really thoughtful and i bet he really appreciates the present, and would say thank you if he were here!</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Okay Human Courtship Is Definitely A Strange Thing And Its Sort Of Blowing My Mind Listening To This</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Think Ill Talk To Someone Else Now</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: why don't you talk to john?</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Maybe</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: When Along His Timeline Would You Recommend Communicating With Him</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: oh man, i don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: why don't you pick the time that will make the most complicated mess out of everything imaginable?</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: you know that's what you're gonna do anyway.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Considering That Youre Obviously Not That Smart</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Basically Understand Whipping Bugwinged Fuckall About Even The Most Elementary Temporal Mechanics</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Am A Bit Perplexed As To Why I Find Myself So Vehemently Fondling The Short End Of The Antagonism Stick Here</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Kind Of Irritating</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Im Going To Talk To Your Comrades</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: This John Human</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Figure Out Whats Going On</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: ok.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: if you talk to him in the past...</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: he'll understand even less buggywhipped fuckall about time, and he'll be confused.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: so maybe paste something from this conversation to him? i don't know.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: and if you talk to him in the future...</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: he'll probably know all this stuff, like things you've said to him but haven't said yet!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: and then you'll be confused.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: sorry, that's just how this works.</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: don't say i didn't warn you!</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Consider Me Fully Briefed On The Matter.</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Until Next Time Rose</span>
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Next Time In The Past</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: yeah, bye!</span>
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: (heheheheheheh)</span>
